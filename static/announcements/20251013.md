# What's New?

In addition to various bug fixes and user experience improvements we continue to try to make, the following new features and capabilities have been added to DataCore:

## General

- Improved performance in crew load time.

- Moved the last of the runtime item post-processing into Autosync.

- Bug fixes for mobile platform data loading.

## Main Page

    - Helps you to identify potential gaps in your roster.

- New trait filters:

    - Main Cast
    - Not Main Cast

- New Special Views drop-down:

    - View all as immortal: View all crew in your roster as if they are immortalized.

- Rankings and Scoring:

    - Rank columns now appear in their order of greatest to least weight from left to right.

    - Current weightings modal now includes Voyage+, Base+, and Gauntlet+ inner breakdowns.

## Fleet Page

- The fleet page can now ingest data from more than one fleet.
    - Useful for admirals with multi-fleet families.
    - Note: You must have already loaded player data from each fleet at least once, prior to using mutli-fleet features.

## Event Planner

- Crew ship abilities are now displayed in lieu of skill powers for skirmish event phases.

- Cleaner, left-justified formatting of event information.

    - Recurring Mega card is now displayed, if applicable.

## Voyage Calculator

- The crew excluder now shows current quipment on crew in the browsing pane.
    - Added quipped and not-quipped filters.

- Crew Quipment Excluder now has an editor modal.
    - Exclude the best single skill.
    - Exclude crew with the longest remaining average time.

- Crew Notes Excluder now has an editor modal, as well.

- Introducing the Dilemma Helper

    DataCore now has the ability to ingest your voyage log and find your dilemmas. You
    can also use the dilemma helper to test the selection of a dilemma you are sitting at,
    or you can simply browse through the dilemmas.

    Multipart dilemmas have special visual cues to indicate their eligibility during the current voyage.

    Max voyage time is calculated based on which dilemmas have been answered.

- Various bug fixes

## DataScore

- Score rebalancing (already live).

- See current score weightings.

- Composite score weighting breakdowns in weightings information modal.

- "Versatility" score: This number is derived from the difference between the crew's calculated effective index and its actual index. This has the effect of allowing exceptional crew that are in a crowded space to be surfaced. (Likewise, more mediocre crew can be suppressed.)
