Rurigan spent the first 18 months or so in the game as an excellent, then solid Voyager, but sadly he’s reached the point in the game where his sole remaining value is his Trait list (it’s a Trait-based game, kids). The best Yaderan in the game has hit a Grand Slam of Collections (that’s four for those not familiar with baseball) by now and a long-shot Romantic just MIGHT get him to five one day. If those Traits give him weekend Event work, solid Base stats will come into play.
