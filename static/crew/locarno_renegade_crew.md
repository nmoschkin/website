ðŸŽµThe jig is up, the news is out, 
We finally found him. 
A renegade who had it made, 
retrieving a bounty.
Once again heâ€™s gone astray,
Will it be the end today
Of this wanted man?ðŸŽµ

Heâ€™s back, and ready to get his revenge! Nick here may or may not look eerily like Tom Paris, depending on who you ask, but oh boy does he have a bone to pick with Starfleet in ways that oft-disciplined Tom never did. Seems like he never learned his lesson after getting kicked out of school. Simply put, this guy sucks!

But wait, he does have some redeeming qualities in Timelines! In a skill triplet apparently dominated by Animated Crew, Renegade Locarno is one of the top Voyagers any way you break down the skills and traits. He may not be a shoo-in for every run but you can bet heâ€™ll be riding seats for you for a while. Meanwhile traits such as Scoundrel, Crafty, and Desperate have shown themselves to be common Event choices, so you can expect he and his healthy CMD Base to make an appearance on Shuttles when they are called upon. Those same three traits will hopefully one day find themselves a Collections, as for now he only has two (both Stat-Boosting) to his name. Befitting of someone who could have been the best pilot in Starfleet, he offers a respectable +15000 Crit Bonus in Ship Battles as well, though with eerily similar in stats to fellow Animated CMD/ENG/SCI Voyager Emotionally Heightened Tâ€™Lyn, heâ€™s her inferior here if youâ€™ve already managed to add her to your roster.
