You ever just have one of those days? Work is stressful, you feel like you are stuck on a ship out alone in the middle of nowhere, and boy don’t get me started on those annoying coworkers? Maybe the best course of action is just to enjoy some quiet time in the local pub – aaaaaaaand now a coworker is drinking your brain from a straw...and another coworker is ringing, and won’t answer the damn phone...and not to mention your ex is literally now a delicious cake, and no one offered you a slice?

I mean, we’ve all been there! Mondays, am I right? 

Or one of the most memeable and memorable scenes in late TNG – Phantasms. Yeah, maybe that’s it.

But you’re not here for episode commentary, you’re here for Timelines Crew Commentary!

This crew is good.

That’s it. That’s the note.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Still here? Need more? Best Voyaging Riker, top Voyaging Crusher. Riker with MED. 

Still don’t believe me? Eight AM Trait seats on Voyages where the CMD/SEC/MED triplet is best in the game.

Need even more? You’ll use this card for daily Shuttles or on Crusher/Riker/various Trait bonus Faction Events until the end of the game, which is probably coming soon (Certified Watermarked Guarantee™).

Haven’t been convinced yet? Two Collections at launch with two more in the hopper – how's that?

This card is a veritable Swiss Army knife of utility (ask your parents, kids!) and you should consider going to Skirmish war to get them.

Let the bloodbath begin. Now please, won’t somebody answer that damn ringing?
