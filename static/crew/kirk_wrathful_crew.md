He seems to have lost his communicator somewhere 'round the moons of Nibia, but Kirk still has his phaser locked and loaded. A strong SEC base is up in lights on the marquee and "Starring Captain Kirk" has been the tagline for more Events than any other character in the game's history. Phased out of Voyages by now, but with a couple Traits beyond the bare minimum to supplement Kirk's highs, his brand name and power numbers will make an echoing presence on your roster.
