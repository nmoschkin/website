While Lady Beverly possesses a rather thin Trait list, she’s managed to snag a spot in the Pet People Collection so you can one day get yourself a copy of Data and Spot. Otherwise, her traits will likely top her out at four Collections, so you can safely pick up copies of Bev and her Cockatoo at your leisure and get paid off whenever Beverly or Trait Events come up, or if WRG deems one of her Traits worthy of a new Collection (i.e. “content”).
