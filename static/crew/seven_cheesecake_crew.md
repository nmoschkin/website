For a long time, players hoped to luck into a Legendary Behold that included Mobile Doctor just so they could fuse him with Indignant Seven to make this powerful Fusion crew, affectionately known as “Cheesecake Seven”.

Nowadays the drool has dried a bit because Power Creep™ comes for them all, including this crew that counts as both EMG and Seven of Nine for Events, but Cheesecake held Power Creep off longer than anyone, due to the fact that they have a nearly unmatched eight Voyage Anti-matter Traits and a unicorn Skill set and order, including the delectable MED/ENG pairing.

Look for Indulgent Seven to continue to hold some long-term value from their Event pedigree, stellar Trait List, and how Fusing crew is so damn fun! You will need to Cite this crew to Immortalize them but it may be worth it even though they’re no longer daily use due to the possibility for up to five Collections in due time.
