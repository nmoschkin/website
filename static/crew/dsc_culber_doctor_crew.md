Kids these days have no idea about the OG Titan Hugh Culber. The first draft of the Big Book discussed his legitimate Voyage potential and obscene Shuttle lead over the field with Discovery Mega Events stretching out as far as the eye can see. Now it's "Oh, he's in the Physician Collection."

He is indeed and in one of our few accurate crystal ball moments, WRG has provided Culbs a few bonuses yearly in the wake of Discovery's Mega Event disappearance. He may still hold down some non-bonus Shuttle work on weekends, especially if you're missing the 1-Skill Bones, but barring an unforeseen return to those endless Discovery Megas Events, Culber's value can only increase via the longshot Romantic collection.
