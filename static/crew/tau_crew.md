Who? Tau Ceti? Tau Cannon? I think he's that guy from the one episode where-- oh who cares, what Collections does he have? 

If you just HAVE to have Tau for his role in everybody's favorite *checks notes* Voyager episode in which Janeway hang glides with Gimli while wearing a dress, then you'll be glad to know that his least likely Collection trait was the first to hit and surely won't be his last. There is more non-Collection use here than you might think from a hard-to-place name and he should qualify for thawing during a handful of Trait Events in the future as well. Not notably elite, but likely to increase in value over time, since he could hit all five of his Traits with corresponding Collection spots.
