Learn to be fully erect with this ONE WEIRD TRICK - Chiropractors HATE him!

Despite Kirk's disappearing act in 2021, he remains one of the premier Event names in Timelines and Roman slots into a huge blind spot in Kirk's Skill portfolio; DIP (at least where Orions aren't concerned). Even without much Trait help, this variant is a viable candidate for duping if you're a Faction Event connoisseur or, at minimum, the first crew you grab out of Cryostasis. New players, if they can acquire all four stars quickly, may even see him on a Voyage or two before they start to accumulate better Rarity crew in spades.
