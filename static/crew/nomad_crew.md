This note is fresh off a cameo appearance in Season 3 of Lower Decks, in which Nomad is stored in the anomalies storage room of the Cerritos, which is pretty much where this crew should be in game as well. This Probe has four or five viable Traits for Events and Collections, so look for it to be an average to above-average value in those areas, but little else.
