Landry is the posterchild for crappy Mirror Universe crew that pop up in Beholds and make you groan. Thankfully, if you choose Ellen, she’ll eventually pay you off with some Collection boosts to the tune of somewhere between her current pair and a future three more. 

We often opine on the death and subsequent resurrection, then death again(?) of Discovery Mega Events, so it’s possible Landry will find her way into more weekend use outside of her Traits, since Landry ain’t getting variant bonuses.
