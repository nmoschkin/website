Something of a man for all seasons, Martok offers Voyage, Shuttle, Collection, and Ship Ability value in varying degrees. A competitive SECondary and handful of Galaxy Map Node unlocks should earn him at least some level of work on fresh rosters.

Only eligible for Tuesday Cadet Missions and requiring a smattering of Klingon and KCA Faction Items, it’s understandable if you’d rather save your precious Trainers for other crew, though he’s not an objectively poor choice for early Immortalization.
