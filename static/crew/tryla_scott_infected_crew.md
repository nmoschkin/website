Captain Scott’s (no, the other one) theme is budget. Just like Riker’s bluegill, Tryla is a budget piece to get the job done cheaply, though perhaps not always get the job done well.

An Ardra-lite option for Ship Battles, Scott is fine as a fast-activating Accuracy Boost, but is missing the hammer damage that two scoops of Crit Bonus will afford you. Similarly in Gauntlet, she’ll help new rosters get their collective foot in the door of that increasingly cutthroat game mode thanks to competent rolls and an absurd number of elevated Crit Gauntlets - just don’t expect her to stack too many wins against Exclusives or crew built for Gauntlet like Lt. Commander Mitchell.

Her Voyage power has squirmed away over the years like so many wriggling mealworms, so unless your Voyage crew is pretty barren, don’t expect her to snag many rides. Well-rounded in many areas and with some interesting Traits, Tryla is a candidate for Behold Insurance™ and is probably somewhere lower on your list of Crew Retrievals, but isn’t the worst Mega Recurring Legendary we’ve had. Looking at you, Fullerton.
