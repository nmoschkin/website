Yo Man! Where are you Lan-don that shuttle today. Okay fine! you know what, puns are hard. We're only alotted a certain amount of resources for true wit and better writers left me in debt.

Martha certainly earns her security rating, having beaten the local natives on Gamma Trianguli VI, Chekov's heart and other crew in her skillset. While SEC/ENG/SCI may not be the rarest combination of skills, Martha distinguishes herself by leading the pack in both power and utility. Every trait she possesses seems destined to find an antimatter match, making her a superior choice compared to many other crew members, unless, of course, you happen to luck into acquiring Grady from a voyage..

Having a good SEC option for voyages and shuttles is also a bonus if you are saving crew to send off on Continuum Missions for that sweet Quantum and Dilithium boost then no doubt this Yeoman becomes a preferred selection over other contemporaries, even those with higher rankings. For some she might even be daily use crew, however, it's worth noting that her lack of event participation and limited representation in the Gauntlet hinder her from achieving true all-rounder status. Nevertheless, don't hesitate to invest a few citations in her.

The future trajectory of Martha's standing in the roster might be influenced by TPG's commitment to investing in alternative skill sets and empowering them. Yet, based on the available evidence, Martha is poised to maintain her effectiveness within the upper echelons of your crew roster for some time.
