HELLO CLEVELAND! ARE YOU READY TO ROCK!? 

Mariner shreds her way into the game with a dynamite new Legendary variant, slinging a killer axe into the ranks of the “Crew Holding Musical Instruments” Collection! Just kidding, that isn’t a real one. Yet. In all seriousness, Mariner’s command of the rock and roll genre of music gives her a solid CMD base, which will inevitably give her Shuttle work when her name is called to the stage for Events. Look for Lower Decks Mega Events or Trait-based bonuses from her solid setlist.

Three Collections sets her solidly in the middle of the pack among Legendaries and she’s got an encore planned with perhaps one or two more hits. THANK YOU!
