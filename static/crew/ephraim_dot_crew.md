One of the best hugging crew in the game, E&D debuted as a fine Voyage option but as it does, Power Crept has reduced their long-term value to their Trait list. It’s paid off handsomely so far with a quartet of Collections but that’s all they’ll get until Automated Unit and Tardigrade inevitably get theirs (not). A fine project to add stars via Behold or Crew Retrieval, but don’t jump to Immortalize them like it’s 2021.
