Diplomacy at the end of an...arrow? A former top ten Voyager, MM Troi has little left to offer todayâ€™s player outside of what she can fire off from the Traits in her quiver. A single Stat-boosting Collection and her episode Vanity are all she has been able to hit at this point, but Troi Events are common enough and her DIP Base large enough to make an impact, and she could still strike the target with a few more Collections one day.
