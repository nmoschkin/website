Trait-rich like his variant brethren, this Mudd comes pre-loaded with potential. His handful of Anti-matter traits in concert with serviceable Voyage power give him a chance to overcome a pretty bland Skill set in the early game and make some runs until fused Legendary crew begin to edge him out. 

That Trait engine also powers almost all of Harry's weekend work. While the spotless reputation of Harcourt Mudd has earned him a handful of weekend features, it's traits that supercharge him toward an outrageous number of thawpertunities, including a 2019 that saw him notch *twenty-two* Event bonuses, including Discovery Mega Events.

And while 'Jippers on a Beach' is a serviceable Arena ability for newcomers, the headline for most players is probably his strong set of four Collections with room for up to three more. He's a must-have for everyone at some point as you enter the phase of the game where ticking Collection boxes for stat boosts becomes in vogue and a few fortuitous future Collections may cement him as one of the best Collection values in the game.
