The crew with the most tribbles in the game, Tribbled Koloth and Korax (colloquially known as TKK and henceforth in this note as well) are the only SEC-Primary Gauntlet Exclusive, and while they do not have the best Proficiency for the Skill, their supplementary Skills blow likes of Tiny Tert Gangster Spock and the All-Terrain Burnham out of the water. With plenty of elevated Crit Gauntlets and competitive rolls in the decidedly uncompetitive CMD/ENG pair, TKK slots in nicely as yet another Exclusive to do it all.

Like most Gauntlet crew, abhorrent Bases sink their Voyage and Shuttle work, but the card is otherwise redeemed. The most valuable Collection spot in the game joins several others to make TKK a must-have crew for late game players looking to stack Skill Costs. They have a handful of other untapped Traits saved for a rainy day and will certainly tempt unlucky Gauntlet-goers when they pop up in a fancy new Gauntlet Behold.

Both interesting and usable is their Ship Ability. Big Instant Damage and a desirable Attack Boost are tempered by a hair-slow Triigger and huge Evasion handicap. Theoretically this crew could save you from citing up another Attack Boost Arena option, but you have to ask yourself one question. Do you feel lucky, punk? Wellâ€¦do ya?
