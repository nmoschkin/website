Data Event chances, main cast status, reasonable metrics, fun themed holiday artwork, and a partridge in a pear tree. Scrooge isn't a power hitter, but with an impressive portfolio headlined by multiple features every year, he'll never fall completely from grace.

A smattering of Collection tree ornaments adorn Ebenezer to keep him afloat as his daily use ability sinks. He may not recapture the power or Trait potential from his youth, but he's learned a valuable lesson along the way.
