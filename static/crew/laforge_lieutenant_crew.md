While the application of the Romantic trait is among the most egregious in the game, it’s a nice distraction from the rest of this card. Without cadet eligibility to justify an early leveling push, the only carrot on the end of the long term value stick is some poor collection value. Feel free to skip La Forge early on unless you’re completely lacking ENG options.
