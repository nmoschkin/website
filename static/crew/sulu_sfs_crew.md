It took nearly three years for Sulu to collect his first variant Event and with Bases like his, it wasn't worth the wait. Despite enjoying a wealth of Traits, Sulu's Event history is quite spotty. The half glass full guy would say that's bound to change.

Indeed, Sulu owns several Traits in the right range for Collections and their accompanying introductory Mega Event. He could become a relatively valuable option overnight. 'Could' being the operative word. At the moment he's a bit of new player Gauntlet option with tons of elevated Crit sets including three 45% combinations and a joke Ship Ability that Initializes tomorrow and hides behind a Cloak Trigger.
