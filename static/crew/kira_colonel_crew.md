“Well, it’s not Starfleet Command unless they throw us a few curveballs.” she says, *while holding Captain Sisko’s freakin’ baseball*! Now, if she’d just stop arguing with Shaxs about who owes who, she could get around to doing her job.

That’s right, Colonel Kira is now in charge of DS9. She’s also been assigned top-level Voyaging ability, even if it is yet another CMD/DIP/SUCK permutation. Coming in strong in every single Antimatter seat she’s eligible for (and there are many), Kira here will get plenty of use no matter where you are in your Timelines journey. Thanks to finally getting a Bajoran Collection, said traits also bring with them Five Stat-Boosting Collections, giving the Colonel (is Bajoran Fried Chicken a thing?) lots of long-term value even after she gets replaced by yet another Voyager in this Skillset. 

A couple of decent Bases also means that she’ll provide some healthy Event work when her traits get called in for Faction duty, something she has historically seen a lot of. For those still lacking the standard 400% Booms in Arena/Fleet Boss Battles, Kira can help out with a 350% Instant Damage as well, albeit hidden behind a position trigger. All in all a pretty great package for the return of this iconic character, so if you can pull yourself away from monitoring Quark and all of his shenanigans, make sure to grab a copy if the chance presents itself!
