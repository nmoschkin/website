Just like Delta Flyer Paris, MCM’s unicorn Skill set will no longer buoy his long term value on Voyages because his overall power is way too low. Four Traits give him little chance to contribute in the areas of the game that matter; Events and Collections, so the fact that he gets a free Collection from being on Enterprise is a nice plus. At best he’ll end up with a trio of Collections, and you have to dream about Mayweather Events to bring his value up further from the floor.
