The two stops on this bumpy trip to the wormhole are the Gauntlet and Traits. Gauntlet Exclusive Balok was the worst possible news for Opaka; his power is dominant and his Crit values are double dominant. She might pull a new player's chestnuts out of the fire in a really bad Legendary Behold, but isn't an option for top rosters.

A set of strong Traits are the back half of this crew. It's within the realm of possibility that she ends up as a five Collection piece. If she does and you passively add some stars for that purpose, don't expect her to break out of requisition Shuttle territory until her last star, but at least she'll have a handful of bonus Shuttles she can pilot down the line.
