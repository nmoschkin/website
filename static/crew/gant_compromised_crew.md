Expired Gant channels his best Dr. Strange as he claims he can see all permutations of the future. We at the BigBook are going to attempt to do the same regarding him.

Gant enters the game with some decently usable Shuttle and Voyage stats thanks to a certified BigBase™ SEC score, meaning early adopters can be sure to see some use out of Burnham’s former crewmate on SEC/CMD Voyages or in Faction Events. Disco may be dead, but Federation and Duelist have been known to get called to the plate for weekend work, and traits like Tactician and Saboteur are due some love. In fact, the time crystal tells me that there is hope for a few more Collections in Kamrans future with possibly four more as yet untapped traits just begging for some overpriced Mixed Beholds.

This semi-rosy picture starts to fade as time goes on, however, as besides the trait list things start to get replaceable. As yet another CMD/DIP/SUCK permutation, don’t expect his Voyage use to be more than niche, if any at all, given WRG’s penchant for adding crew to this Triplet. That SEC Base is interchangeable with the rest of the top scores in this crowded skill as no one really stands above the rest in terms of irreplaceability. His non-existent Gauntlet use will certainly not improve, and given that Increased Accuracy Boost is not part of any current ship battle meta, *and* that this ability is trapped behind a Position Trigger, there’s no hope for him there either.

If Galaxy Events are your thing, don’t be afraid of grabbing a copy or two from his debut Event. If this is one of the infinite possible futures and you’ve found him in a Behold, you can do a lot better or a lot worse. And if you just really have a thing for Discovery minor characters, well hey, isn’t that what Crew Retrieval is for?
