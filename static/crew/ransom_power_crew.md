INCOMING TRANSMISSION FROM THE BIG GIANT HEAD

Hey kids! Do you like Gauntlet? Do you like Beholds? Now, let me ask you this – what do you think about GAUNTLET BEHOLDS? I see waves of you passing out from excitement, so I probably should just ask if you want your recent Gauntlet Exclusive crew to be rapidly replaced, again.....wait, where are you all going? Don’t leave! I was just going to offer you a BEHOLD!

That’s right, hovering in hot to every 65% Gauntlet rotation you want to skip, it’s the all-powerful, god-like head of Commander Ransom, straight from a workout and ready to feel the burn of your weakling Gauntlet opponents.  

Ransom is a one-trick pony – Gauntlet. He’s not going to make a Shuttle, he’s not going to Voyage, he’s not going to make a serious dent in any of the two Collections he offers. What he will do, and he will do it *well*, is create a wall of floating heads in Gauntlet, causing you to hit the “Refresh: 50 Merits” button faster than an army of Ransomites can develop a gym equipment planet. Armus held his own for five years, but the reign of murderous ink monsters is over.

But I’m burying the lead story here – WRG saw it fit to debut a looooooong request feature with Power Ransom – the Gauntlet Behold. Instead of a random drop of the new Legendary or an older former exclusive, you now get a Behold popup with a selection of three Gauntlet cards. Finally – players who have long suffered under the cruel treatment of RNGesus can now look forward to filling some holes in the ever-expanding Gauntlet exclusive pool. Just make sure if you see a glorious floating head in that Behold, you click it fast!

All Hail Ransom
