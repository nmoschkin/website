Sadly Mendon has fallen from grace somewhat. His Shuttle score is outpaced by most other 3* SCI/ENG crew due to his low bases however he has enough variation with his skill set to afford him use on a Voyage or two when you are new. Keep him in mind should you be lacking SCI or ENG crew but don't rush him to promotion. What else you need to know about Rare crew in the game is if they have weekend Cadet Mission eligibility (he does on Saturday) and will he check the boxes in any non-rarity Collections (two). Mendon is one Rare crew you may not want to airlock immediately, but maybe in the second round of purging your crew quarters.
