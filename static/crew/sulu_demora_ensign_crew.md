Sulu supplied her sole sweet spot in the Pilot Mega Event that closed out 2018 and with a list of crowded and un-Eventable Traits, that may be her last chance to help you outside of a Pilot/SEC node unlock in the Celestial Temple Distress Call. Demoraâ€™s two additional viable Traits may match up with a Collection release eventually, but until then add a notch to her solo existing one.
