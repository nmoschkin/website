Swords akimbo, this illustrious holofanatic scores high among his peers with ENG skills. His triplet of ENG/SEC/SCI makes him an essential Voyager for the very early game. If you are currently sporting a starship with a Position ability then his +10000 crit bonus will be very useful. Sadly no Cadet mission eligibility, but his Innovator Collection bonus makes him worth keeping around, plus a possible Duelist Collection inclusion one day.
