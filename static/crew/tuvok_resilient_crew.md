Blindvok was true to his namesake on Voyages for a good long time due to his strong Skill set and Traits giving Anti-matter bonus matches, but no longer. Now you can find Tuvok pitching in as a long term investment for Collections and Events, with a bevy of Traits, some tapped for Collections and some still in waiting.
