Born as an impressive daily use option, Quark is making the graceful transition to Collection era target. Seven viable Traits, all with the potential to be "something" in the future, gives him plenty of whacks at the Collection and Event pi√±ata. With variant Events as a cushion, Tourist Quark turns a build cost light on Ferengi Faction Items into a bargain payoff that would make any Ferengi blush.
