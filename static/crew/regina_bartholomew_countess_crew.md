A woman of breeding and wit, the Lady Bartholomew has certainly earned her considerable Diplomacy base. If you don't believe me, just ask Viscount Oglethorpe. Unfortunately, she won't have a great many chances to truly shine on Shuttles; Hologram being the only Trait to have granted multiple Event bonuses to date and her other Traits being so populous. If indeed opposites do attract, you can consider her a matching pair with Adam - another one-off who's likely to snag some non-bonus requisition work in the right situation. Sadly lacking any flair in the areas of Gauntlet, Arena, or Collections, the Countess is at least viable on Voyages and should slightly outperform a rather tame overall rank. With the number of higher ranked Voyagers who own the Hologram Trait able to be counted on one hand, she'll often have that seat to herself on runs for which you desire a charming conversation partner.  With many older crew, the Trait set provides lasting value and with Reginaâ€™s set falling somewhat short of some of her peers, you may find yourself passing over her in Beholds and on Crew Retrieval Lists.
