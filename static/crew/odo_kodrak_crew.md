Never mind that silly tinghamut, it’s just a silly Vulcan toy for children. No, the real spoils of war from the raid on Archanis is this amazing Odo variant art. Let’s all just sit back and take a moment to appreciate it…

Five years after playing a human disguised as a Klingon, Rene Auberjonois got to play a Changeling disguised as a Klingon. Over Two and a Half years later, Kodrak joins Star Trek Timelines as a largely much better option (that’s crew ageing for you).

Tragically yet another CMD/DIP/SEC permutation, Kodrak’s use there is buried by so many others, though if you’ve yet to find yourself a copy of those elusive SEC/DIP voyagers from your Voyage rewards he may have a longer leash on your roster. For many players, he’ll be plugged in when you want to focus on AM trait bonuses rather than pure raw power, and early adopters will get a bit of use out of him before the next iteration of this skillset shows up.

For more long term use, he has favourable Event Potential thanks to being both an Odo and a Klingon, debuting in the log jammed upper levels of SEC Base scores. Beyond that there’s four candidates for Collections amongst his trait list, making him an investment in the future for the elderly players looking into their crystal balls.
