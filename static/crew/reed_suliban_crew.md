Dominic Keating described the process of having this makeup put on as horrific, and lo and behold the card representing that episode is equally as bad. 

If you pick up this Reed from a nightmare of a Legendary Behold very early on in your game (and God, who were the other two choices if you picked him?) you can get some Gauntlet use from his passable Proficiencies. Reed Events get as much love as Malcolm's character development on Enterprise, with entire years skipped (2019, 2021, 2022), so the only long-term investment for this crew is his Trait list. None of his viable ones have generated a Collection place yet, but if they all do, you could be in for a medium sized surprise with a total of four possible.
