"Does it matter? You get the one, you get that other one. Personally, I think the whole arrangement's a little..."

This is whimsy done right and Fusion done wrong. The Bynars, a years-long punchline, may be having the last laugh during WRG's 'Collection Era'. All three having picked up a single Collection already makes them worth acquiring to some extent and they have room for growth in that area.

The resultant Legendary Bynar being, well, *craptacular* means that you don't need to rush to finish them and can instead treat these purple Super Rares as some handy Behold Insuranceâ„¢ and continue to select the pair in an otherwise dead-end Gehold.
