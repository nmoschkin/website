All-Terrain Burnham is her first Gauntleteer variant and helps flesh out a well-rounded Timelines character. She parlays strong SEC and overall Proficiency numbers into two respectably ranked Gauntlet pairs; both close enough to catch number one sleeping if she brings a Crit advantage. She's a near auto-include in her pair of 45% Gauntlets and is otherwise spunky enough to be in the rotation mix alongside similar names like Gangster Spock and Gary Seven.

No longer finding Voyage work due to her age, ATB finds Event work as a Burnham variant as well as latching on to Trait bonuses to provide additional value. Three Collections could grow to six, so feel satisfied taking her in Legendary Beholds at any Fusionlevel.
