Springing, fully formed, from the pile of characters where you look at them and go, 'yeah, they were only ever going to be CMD/DIP/SUCK,' Brunt does at least have the decency to stand out in a few key ways. For one, Ferengi Voyagers don't grow on trees, so he can duke it out with a few Quarks and Krem (notedly another Combs portrayal) for the usually vacated seat, asking Timelines players what they value more, gold-pressed latinum (raw Voyage power) or their ideals (rare Skill set).

The drawbacks should be familiar by now - the Skill set is tired, and though ameliorated by his unique set of Traits, it's still hard to get excited to see the little star, the little laurel, and the little phaser in that worn out order. His Collection value is for the most part baked in, but there are chances for a ceiling of five if everything swings his way.

Events are mostly confined to non-bonus Shuttle work (for which I might be able to interest you in a certain tribble?) and the long requested, long imagined Ferengi Mega Event, while Gauntlet would be DOA even before we got to the rolls with this Skill set - let's face it, if you aren't an Exclusive, you don't stand a chance these days. Brunt definitely isn't a crew for everyone, but for people who like their Traits covered, their DS9 supporting cast played by Jeffrey Combs, and their haberdasheries on the third floor, Brunt is for you.
