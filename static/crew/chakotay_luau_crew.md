Beltran Stans (Beltstans? That’s an ugly portmanteau…) rejoice! Luau Chakotay limbos his way into the game and finally gives Voyager enjoyers another reason to celebrate! It’s a party… I mean a Luau!

Look, it’s been awhile since we could write a positive note for a Chakotay crew variant, so we’re bound to be rusty on the puns. While Chuckles is saddled with his top two Skills being DIP/CMD, which are as common as sand on the beach, his tertiary MED puts him atop his Skill order and only behind powerhouse Vedala Elder in his Skill set (any permutation). Five Antimatter Traits further buoy his Voyage seating chances.

But wait, there’s more! As we follow the Traits, look to see Luau gather up to four Collections as time goes on, but for now enjoy his relatively low debut of two. All in all, it’s nice to see a daily use Chakotay that doesn’t rely on RNG on Voyage Beholds at a 1% clip to find.
