Add Fencing Picard to the list of “this crew used to be the NUMBER ONE VOYAGER!”

While no longer in the upper echelons of those rankings, Fencing has a still-respectable Voyage rank with enough Antimatter Traits to allow him to ride when his common Skill set allows. Traits also give him long-term value, not only for Trait bonus Events Thursday to Monday, but as a possible inclusion in up to five Collections. We haven’t even mentioned Picard-variant Event chances, where the common Skill set that gives him a little less Voyage utility gives him many more options for Shuttle seating.
