Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer,
Swung by Sarin whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.
“Wretch,” I cried, “thy Goddess of Empathy—by these Red Angels he hath sent thee,
Respite—respite and Nepenthe Riker, from thy memories of Lenore;
Quaff, oh quaff this kind Nepenthe Troi and forget this lost Lenore!”
Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”

“Prophet Kira!” said I, “thing of evil!—Prophet Sarah still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above us—by that QasGod we both adore—
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Ensign,
It shall clasp a sainted Karidian whom Captain Angel names Lenore—
Clasp a rare and radiant Croden whom the Angel Gabby names Lenore.”
Quoth the Raven, “Nevermore.”
