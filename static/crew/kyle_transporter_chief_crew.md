He does wear that red jumpsuit well, doesn’t he? Kyle enthusiasts waited years for this Super Rare Crew to debut, and he did so with a… whimper? Thinly Traited but at least with two Collections (that’s all he’s gonna get), consider making Kyle a choice of last-resort in your Super Rare Beholds, then beam him straight to Cryostasis.
