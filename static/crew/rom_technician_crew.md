Rom is an odd juxtaposition of great ENG power with scant cadet eligibility. He has a few uses in the early game, but generally isn’t worth the resources as young, trainer-strapped rosters struggle to keep ahead of the influx of new event cards. With a trait list on the meaty side for Uncommon crew, he’s more of a juicy midgame leveling project for rosters looking to build up their collection stat boosts.
