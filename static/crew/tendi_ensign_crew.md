Full cadet eligibility is great to see, though her somewhat weak secondary and tertiary skills may struggle with Epic difficulty node unlocks thanks to a lack of most of the relevant SCI-centric traits. Luckily the utility doesn’t end there.

A Bones-esque Grand Slam shuttler, Tendi debuts as the top option for all MED (“and”) seats available and has a juicy early game skill set to pair with great voyage power that should see her perform there alongside Rare options. With worthwhile collection value as well, Tendi is a fine choice for your precious trainers at any stage of the game.
