Episode 9’s Borg victory reward (provided you don’t mind missing out on some ship battle loot by choosing a Federation victory), Drone Seven is a victim of her age. An ENG primary is more useful on Voyages and in Gauntlet where her power is no longer effective, even for Super Rare Crew, and hurts for shuttle seating opportunities, with it and MED being the redheaded stepchildren of Skills.

Only three traits is nearly a death knell for most crew and so it's a minor miracle that Seven has snagged a difficult to complete Stat-Boosting Collection, a 65% gauntlet, and a reasonable number of Events thus far. While those could all be beneficial for the right player in the right situation, her years-old power lets her down in most of those areas. New players aside, there’s just no longer much here for the average player.

With her traits obviously severely limiting her future Collection potential, at least she’s an easier to complete crew compared to the Borg Legendaries, so snagging copies when presented with the chance is a niche investment in the future.

With her traits obviously severely limiting her collection potential, feel free to pass on this Borg until you're ready to reach a collection threshold or if you're brand new and could squeeze a few battles out of her in the gauntlet.
