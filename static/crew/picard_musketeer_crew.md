Musky Picardâ€™s only point of entry into daily use is the Gauntlet - his metrics there won't blow anyone away, but acceptable Proficiencies have a number of elevated Crit Gauntlets to allow him spot duty if your roster isn't yet totally stocked. 

Beyond that it's the typical Event/Collection pairing we see more and more of from older crew. The Picard Event train runs on time and the majority of his Traits are still Event-able enough. Those same Traits show reasonable Collection promise and will help keep his desirability afloat as he descends to pure (perhaps freezable) Event piece.
