Just look at that Event count. The event count of a thinker. A warrior. A man for all seasons. Yes, Spock is all that and more. But he is not perfect. Perhaps his greatest fault is that he has aged out of Voyage use as all older Spocks (Nimoy Spocks) have.

But if Beardless Disco Spock did nothing else for your roster, he would still be quite possibly the busiest weekend warrior this game may ever see. The utility may not be off the charts, but Spock is an empire unto himself and an established Event piece that you don't want to be without, especially now that he's managed to Vulcan nerve pinch his way into yet another show, and a fan favorite one at that. All those delectable Traits only add to the Event chances, and look for him to top out at five or six Collections before the day is done.
