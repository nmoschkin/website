The next time you’re frustrated with your job, be careful about bottling up your negative emotions. Especially if you’re holding an alien cube…

Perhaps the most aggressively average of the Tendi variants, Hank Scorpio here is certainly not useless. Lovers of her character/the art aside, players will want to chase her if they are fans of Voyage seat optimising and Med Tertiary boosting. Small improvements on your roster’s overall Voyage strength are still worth it to some play styles…are they right for you? This carries over to shuttles, and therefore Events, much less so as her SEC Base is buried behind many other crew in almost all of her Traits. 

Speaking of Traits, this Tendi adds Brutal and Explorer Collection spots to the expected Orion and Animated ones, giving her a total of four Stat-Boosting Collections in total. Unfortunately she’s almost tapped out here though, with only one more realistic candidate. So, be happy if you earn a copy, but don’t go rampaging through the mess hall just to earn one.
