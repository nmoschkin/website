Garak lost his unique Tailor Trait in the audit that preceded Crew Retrievalâ€™s launch, and basically lost most of his allure. Not all of it though, since his remaining Traits have secured him a racial Stat-boosting Collection, and hopes for three more of them. For the very early game, hitch your wagon to his big SEC Base and decent Voyage numbers, then send him to Cryostasis when applicable.
