Among this author’s favorite art in the game, T’Ana and Shaxs play on the Cerritos’s Holodeck and here comes the Bonnie to his Clyde. 

As you might expect, dual wielding revolvers gives our grumpy Caitian CMO a sizable SEC Base, and in those barrels she also holds enough Traits to blow away our expectations for current and future Collections, as well as bonus Events. Also on point with this theme is her Ship Ability, with a +11 Attack Boost possible with a Boarding Trigger, easy to find these days. 

If you want to use T’Ana on Voyages you may want her Immortalized stat, because her power is a bit wanting for a 2023 Legendary, even with her incredibly rare Skill set, which Lower Decks compatriot Corrupted Badgey currently has a stranglehold on. She might struggle to find Voyage seating, with each of her quintet of Anti-matter seats having heavy competition.
