True to Star Trek fashion, this excellent Jadzia variant (at last, but more on that later!) is born of an episode that takes aim at taboo and prejudice common in our own society. Under-appreciated at the time, it has grown in popularity thanks to this message (and the acting chops of the always wonderful Terry Farrell).


But you’re not here to listen to me wax poetic on morality, you’re here to watch me hit dingers! And in some ways, that’s exactly what this crew does! First, the art. If this character had nothing else going for it, the Big Book Collective would go to bat for Jadzia just for the art alone. Somewhat Darlene Kursky-esque in its realism, you can do a lot worse than stare at her on your Bridge. Beyond that, however, lies a useful-on-launch JDax variant we’ve long been clamouring for. She will be able to ride shuttles on the many Events this absolute workhorse of a name and trait set pulls in each year thanks to a set of hearty SCI and DIP bases. Finally, her art is fantastic. Seriously folks, have you seen the art?
