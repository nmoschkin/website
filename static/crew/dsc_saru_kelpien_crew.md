Collection roads take me home
To the place I belooong

A five+ Collection Super rare is an automatic acquire, full stop. Even if WRG's crazy train of Collections claims as many victims as they can, you're still paying a nominal equip cost to make progress toward boosting all of your Legendary and six star Ã¼berLegendary crew (I'm from the future. London Kings in six games).

Beyond that, you're mostly looking at a somewhat surprising Event crew. The end of regular Disco Mega Events left a lot of niche crew in the ditch, but Kaminar has done pretty darn well for himself in the years since, notching plenty of bonuses and a handful of Saru features too. While not the picture of daily use, this is still a crew that you (and everyone) should acquire.
