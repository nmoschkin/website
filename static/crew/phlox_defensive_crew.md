Feast and famine is the name of the game for Puffer Phlox, the holder of the top MED Proficiency in the game, but with a frustratingly low minimum that may leave you defenestrating your device when he loses a Gauntlet matchup he was sure to win.

A key building block of the early game player’s Gauntlet team as one of the top options for that game mode that is not Exclusive (i.e. he can be gotten easily from Crew Retrieval), Phlox finds the majority of his value at a single star, but if you can find it in your heart to Fully Fuse this delightful Denobulan, you’ll find yourself rewarded with three Collections with room for one more. 

While Phlox is not unloved for variant Events, you’ll likely find he’s called upon more on his other Traits. With many Gauntlet crew his Bases are truncated to give him the big Proficiencies, but he might staff a requisition Shuttle if Fully Fused.
