Rileyâ€™s sole value at this stage in the game is constituted within her Trait list, which gives her value in daily use if you are helping your Fleet solve Nodes in Fleet Boss Battles, or long term value in anywhere from her current three Collections to a possible ceiling of five. An easy choice for a first or final star from Super Rare Beholds.
