His name is Buck and heâ€™s here to party. Already a strong Collection option, Buck's found his niche and should stick with it. Rounding out a sextet of Collections would be awesome value for a Super Rare and his Event clip seems likely to pick up given all his Traits. Even if you don't use him day to day, he's one of the better long term value prospects from the minor leagues.
