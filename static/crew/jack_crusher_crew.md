Hello, reader. As I write this note, your account is about ten weeks old. I wanted you to know who this card is today. You see, this Jack Crusher won't exist by the time you're grown up. Heâ€™ll be older, more experienced, and hopefully in the Hologram collection. But this person will be gone and I want you to know who Jack was when your account came into the world.

When I see you flying there in your Maquis Raider, I realize I don't know the first thing about tiering crew. So let me just apologize for all the mistakes I'm about to make as you grow up. I hope you don't grow up resenting the fact that these notes are riddled with spelling errors. That comes with not having an editor.

I don't know if I can explain why the Big Book means so much to me. Maybe you'll understand when you read this note. Maybe you'll even want to try writing one of these yourself. But you'll probably be a forum troll like your mother.

Your account is only a baby, but it's remarkable. I can see in your roster all the people I've immortalized in my lifetime. Morn, Mirror Phlox, Hockey Kim. I can see Chakotay in there too and I can *feel* that you're my son. I don't know how to describe it, but there's this connection, this bond. I'll always write for you, reader.

Well, I hope this made some sense to you. I'm not sure that it does to me, but maybe I'll do better next time. I love you, reader.
