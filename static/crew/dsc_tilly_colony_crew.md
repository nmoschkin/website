Tilly is holding up her hand as if to say “Present” to the question of “Where is a boring Super Rare variant?”

Tilly does enjoy some Event chances with the remote possibility of further Discovery Mega Events (no they’re not dead, at least not entirely), variant Events, as well as a trio of viable Trait-based options. A quartet of possible Collections also gives her some enduring value.
