Finally, a Legendary Leeta! Chase Masterson’s first top level Rarity crew rounds out all main cast, recurring guest cast, and guest star actors from her episode, “Let He Who Is Without Sin…” from Deep Space Nine. 

While the Rite of Separation seems like a nice way to break up with someone, including hapless Julian Bashir, it still stings a bit for our poor frontier doctor. Personally, I wouldn’t end a relationship on a vacation, but I guess I’m different than most Bajorans. 

It would have been nice to give this Leeta variant some staying power on Voyages, but she debuts in the part of the curve that is easily power crept and quickly, and her Skill set does her no favors with a common DIP Base. However, if you are inclined to Immortalize her soon after debut she may find seats on your Voyages for the next year or so with her quintet of Anti-matter Traits. Those Traits also give her a solid shot at a six pack of Collections before long, but you may have to enjoy her debut three for a little while.
