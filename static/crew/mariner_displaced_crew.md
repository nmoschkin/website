Tawny Newsome herself in live action, Displaced Mariner comes to us from the superb crossover episode “Those Old Scientists” and if we could give a Tier rating based solely on episode greatness, she’d be Tier 1! Nevertheless, we at the Big Book are objective and we look at the stats. The glorious, magnificent stats. 

Displaced Mariner arrived in a Tuesday Time Portal Pack and while we always espouse the benefits of not pulling 6 packs, if you were willing and able to splash around, you could do far worse than to target her. Debuting in the top 50 of Legendary crew except in the Gauntlet and for Collections (even though she does have a solid debut number of four), Mariner checks the boxes with strong Voyager power and Skill set, Event chances galore (variants and bonus Traits alike), a big SCI Base for Shuttles, and joins the ranks of the 20s Cycle Hull Repair crew with an Attack Boost. Granted that Goodgey has broken the 20s barrier, he’s currency-locked in the Ubercampaign so Mariner is a very suitable replacement. 

In summary, come for how fun the crew is, stay for her stats.
