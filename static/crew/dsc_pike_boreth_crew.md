From a moment in Discovery that even TOS-ers can appreciate, Pike fittingly has signed up for the long haul. Besides some new player utility on Ships (+9 Attack Boost with a -2 Evasion penalty), provided you can acquire enough stars, he points mainly towards late game.

While the three year Discovery Mega Event earthquake has mainly quieted, the December 2022 aftershock notwithstanding, this Pike will need to rely on his Trait list and Discovery spin-off show Strange New Worlds for more Event work. Three current Collections putting him well on the way to his potential of five or six gives him enduring value for any type of player, from baby to elderly.
