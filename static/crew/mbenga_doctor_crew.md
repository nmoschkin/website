Like Civilian Exchange Chapel before him, this bland M’Benga variant (M’Blanda?) has a plus Skill set but without the chops in raw power to back it up on Voyages. We do love MED/CMD, especially when it comes as the Primary/Secondary stack, but as mentioned in the previous line… it saddens us to see it hit like a whimper instead of a roar. As Strange New Worlds rolls on we are hoping for additional variant Events for Joseph, but until then, hope for repeats of Trait-based Mega Events like Physician, Caregiver, and Desperate, and enjoy his average-ish Collection profile.
