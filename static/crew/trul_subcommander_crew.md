Once upon a time, Romulan Seska opened a lot of daily use doors, particularly on the back of her great ENG base. But there aren’t too many 2016 crew who can weather the battering of so many years of power creep and as a result this card has been left with only a short string of Traits for relevance.

Her Event tally is among the worst in the game, so even though she could make the thaw list for many rosters, the odds are against even having the chance in any given year. The light at the end of the tunnel is her set of Collections which ensure that your roster will benefit from Immortalizing Martha sooner or later, but unless you’ve stopped using Super Rares in your day to day gameplay, look to acquire cards with a bit more tangible value to help you transition into an all-Legendary lineup.
