Nanoprobe Phlox may have been the last Honor Hall crew that was a true all-around value upon release, but that was in the summer of 2020 and he has far less value now than he did then.

Where his value has remained and perhaps even improved has been his Trait list and corresponding calls to Event work as well as Collection inclusions. Nano has four Collections and may have room in his pockets for another, if polygamist Phlox can parlay his Romantic Trait into it.

With the expansion of the Borg Collection, Phlox is a must-obtain and Immortalize to finish it as it stands, but we have hope to see more released outside of the Exclusive areas like Honor Hall and Gauntlet. 

Look for Phlox to ride Shuttles when his number is called for Faction Events but he shouldnâ€™t Voyage any longer even with his incredible Skill set which includes the darling ENG/MED pairing. 100,000 Honor may be too steep a price to pay for the Dear Doctor.
