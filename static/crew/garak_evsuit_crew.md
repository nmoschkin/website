A well-rounded murder machine in a suit. Collections are the headline here as the hidden evsuit tag supplements his modest pool of Traits and makes him an automatic Behold choice for anyone past the early game. Also of benefit for longer-term players is an Event history that's stronger than you might think. Though Garak's variant Events aren't as bankable as they were early in the game, his Traits have done some heavy lifting since then and have room for more. Collection oracles can safely predict he picks up two more to make a quintet.

For players who just launched from spacedock, Garak's Arena ability can certainly be useful. +9 Attack that comes online quickly enough for most situations, just be aware that it doesn't last forever. Despite lacking high-value tent poles in the form of Voyage or Gauntlet power, EV Suit Garak offers something for almost everyone and is a Behold pick who won't fall off sharply in value after hitting the cryo vault.
