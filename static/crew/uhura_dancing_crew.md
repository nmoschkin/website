Most of us loathe the thought of collecting another DIP/CMD 2-Skiller, but at least Uhura can contribute in spots. For a time, she was among the best Shuttle crew in the game, but now crowded out of that honor by handfuls of later releases, she waits for Events to boost her into action.

This particular YOUhura enjoys three Stat-boosting Collections and the Timelinesâ€™ Originals Vanity, and has one more viable one secreted away for later. Nyota may dance her way to being Fully Fused from questionable Legendary Beholds.
