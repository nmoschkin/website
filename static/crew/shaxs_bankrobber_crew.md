You ever want to blow off some stress after a hard week at work? Ever come back to life after dying and your partner doesn't ask how that went? Sometimes don't you just wish you could communicate with someone better if you just shot up a bunch of Feds? If you answered yes, then I believe you are the tail-less yang to Cylde...er, Shaxs' yin.

As Lower Decks variants go, Shaxs graces us with his first Super Rare - and he's locked & loaded for action ...if you still use Super Rare characters to Voyage that is, as Shaxs is one of the best option for early game players (or Nightmare Modeâ„¢ enjoyers). Bang Bang Shaxs also excels at a high SEC Base (gee, I wonder why?) and will make shuttles for folks in the same early game struggle. For anyone else, perhaps the pew-pew of a Skirmish event will be enough to earn 3 copies and shoot a cite his way, filling out Four Stat-Boosting Collections (including the new Bajoran!). Beyond those highlights, perhaps a handful of players will find his 4s Crit Bonus in Arena or FBB useful, despite it being locked behind a Boarding Trigger.

OK Fine, maybe we all just enjoy great art of a great character from a great moment, as he battles with the feds in the cold reaches of cryo-freeze.
COMPUTER! RESUME SIMULATION!
