Tribble Quark has most of the value you are looking for from a two year old crew at this point; a myriad of Traits that have already and will continue to bear fruit for Collections, Events, and Fleet Boss Battles combo node unlocks. He’s likely to do you no good on Voyages given his power has been eroded by time.

Tribble Quark’s Trait set is a little lighter than brothers Martian and Convergence Day, but he has the unicorn Tribbled one, which makes him essential to complete that extremely difficult set of crew for that juicy juicy global stat boost.
