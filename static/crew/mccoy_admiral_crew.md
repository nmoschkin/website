Often imitated and long awaited, the proverbial champagne bottle across the bow of the Enterprise-D, Admiral Leonard “Bones” McCoy, has hit Timelines.

He’s green lights across the board on debut. Voyage power that wouldn’t be notable for a crowded skill set sees Bones as one of only two in his skill set among the top 200 voyage ranks. All seven of his traits are there to boost Antimatter for you along with lifting his value in other ways. The Admiral is pre-loaded with a handful of collections to make his immortalization that much sweeter and the McCoy event history is one noted for its strong Faction hit rate, which should give him plenty of opportunities to leverage a great CMD base on the weekends. 

With shipboard attack being the only type of boost relevant for Fleet Boss Battles, it’s nice, then, that this attack-boosting hull repair crew happens to be one that you’re happy to throw stars on anyways. Given that his frailty disqualifies him from locking horns in the gauntlet, Admiral McCoy is just about everything we could have hoped for and easily worth a spot on your roster.
