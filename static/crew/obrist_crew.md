I’ll take “Trait collection dart throws” for $400, Alex. Obrist may be the champion of Quiz Bowl, but the real lightning round lies in the eye of the Toyota Trait-a-thon hurricane booth (The trick is to lick the palms of your hands so the cash sticks to you).

Without any daily use proposition, most players will just be keeping their eye on his Trait list to see how much value to place on a crew who is otherwise a low end Behold dice roll.
