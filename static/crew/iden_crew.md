Iden has what you're looking for, you just don't know it yet. If you want to catch the wave before it crests, be a ground floor investor in traits. 

A zero Collection debut seems to be a dam ready to break for Iden, who boasts a half dozen Traits that are a prime size to be called upon along with a few other big boys that approach Resourceful or Costumed in size. In addition, only Hologram has been featured heavily for Event bonuses, leaving plenty of future thawpertunities on the table for a crew whose skills line up perfectly with the most common Shuttle seats. He's pure speculation on day one, but don't be shocked when he hits pay dirt.
