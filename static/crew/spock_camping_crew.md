Spock is good for the soul. A consistent event performer, Mountaineer's Event history reads like a list of the Allman Brothers' greatest hits (Hey, they're underrated ok?). Yet instead of Spock overload, everyone seems happy each time he comes around. (Norm!)

His Bases, while not spectacular, are feisty enough to earn Shuttle seating with a bonus which happens to occur about every other month. And that long list of Traits grants him a strong combination of immediate and potential Collection value tied to a name who routinely pays off the five star investment on the weekends. 

Boots Spock is also among the best crew to solve Fleet Boss Battles Combo Nodes, so consider a selection in a Behold of even a single star to help your Fleet advance.
