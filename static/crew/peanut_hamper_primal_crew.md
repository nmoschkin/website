"Oh, Rawda, sing for me!"
"… CAW-KAAAA! CAW-KAAA CAW-KAAA!!!"

Two households, both alike in dignity, in fair Areolus, where we lay our scene…(*record scratch*)...ya so, you’re probably wondering how we got here. This mathematically perfectly-named little Exocomp, having previously run off at the first sign of trouble (she only joined Starfleet to piss off her dad) has now found herself stranded on a pre-warp planet and has gone more and more native. Cue fish out of water, cue slowly earned trust, cue love…cue redemption? No, cue shitty, evil little Peanut Hamper.

Peanut joins us in Timelines with a somewhat meaty MED Base, which makes sense if you recall that she was posted alongside Tendi in the Medical Bay, and was really good at surgery. This may sound great, but with so few MED seats on Shuttles (Daily or Faction Event), that’s not going to do much even with her traits having hit a few times a year quite reliably. Where she could serve you, however, is on Voyages, because this MED also pairs nicely with ENG, a still rather underserved pairing. With three Voyage Seat traits to her name, she’ll do excellent niche work even for elderly players. Speaking of traits, she finds herself in five(!) Stat-Boosting Collections at time of her release, with the chance at possibly one more, so there is value here as well. Without any Ship Battle or Gauntlet use to speak of, a love of Lower Decks and/or her character may be what it takes to ever choose her in a pack or BeGold.
