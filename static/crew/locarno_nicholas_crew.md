Admiral Owen's prodigal son has been a punchline since his debut. Some thematically appropriate Evasion on Ships is an option if you can swallow the Accuracy handicap, but realistically he's a popsicle stick with Traits attached. Keep an eye out for some more 'realistic' Mega Event and Collection possibilities like Pilot or Maverick to hit; if enough of them do, he may squeak into contention in inferior Legendary Beholds.
