The model of post-Immortalized value, Moogie offers strong Collections and some sporadic Event work, but is not a daily player. She's one of several crew who can unlock the appropriately named Ishka's Issues DIP Node in Episode Four to help you farm some Polyalloys.

Typically we advise newer players to eschew Collection/Event-only pieces, but Ishka is above average in those areas and may be worth taking in some cases over Super Rares who will (also) only help Fully Fused, even if they're more useful in daily areas like Voyages or Arena.
