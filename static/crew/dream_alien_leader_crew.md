The Leader is good, The Leader is great.
We surrender our will as of this date.

Dream Alien Leader is the latest ÜberKampaign Legendary Crew, and finds himself as an aggressively average offering as crew of his rarity and method of acquisition come. A victim of an overstuffed and much-memed Skill set and order, The Leader does however have enough Voyage power to pitch on occasionally when one of his eight Voyage Antimatter Traits comes calling. Staying on the Trait conversation, he’s only managed to parlay a pair of his lists into current Collections, but if you are willing to invest in a long-term payout, you could see him hit on perhaps four more as time goes on. 

The Leader also features a helpful Ship Ability, if somehow you do not have any of the other literal dozens of surrogates: 400% Instant Damage, popping off at eight seconds, but only twice. So, settle in for a long snooze, since I fell asleep multiple times while writing this note for an uninspiring Campaign crew.
