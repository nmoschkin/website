It's tempting to make this space the 'hard to swallow pills' meme with the words "It takes more than a Skill set to make a good Voyager." Mama Hen Archer was the worst Voyage rank debut in history when he first came out...*years* ago, and time has only dulled his dull edges further.

WRG didn't bother inviting Archer to the Event party until year three of Timelines and even then, his variant Event clip in the time since has been modest. With MED seating so sparse on most Faction weekends, it's conceivable that he's utilized in ENG seats or not at all.

With only three viable Traits to pop for Collections and Events (and Desperate is a generous inclusion), Archer's best role may be as a teacher about Skill sets, power levels, and all things crew eval to those with stars in their eyes upon seeing his MED/ENG combo.
