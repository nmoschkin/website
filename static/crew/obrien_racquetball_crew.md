Racquetball O’Brien may be the prime example of Power Creep™ that seemed to have accelerated to near-Warp 10 velocities in 2022 and 2023. Released with a baller Voyage score and the sort of physique we nerds can only dream of, Miles has found himself edged out again and again by more desirable crew to the point where he’s an edge-case option while all your better crew are on Faction Shuttles. 

Still a stalwart ENG Base for O’Brien and Trait bonus events, he’s still got some room to improve on the Collection front but with few viable Traits left, you might be sending him to Cryostasis cold therapy for his aching calves before long.
