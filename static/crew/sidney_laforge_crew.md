Is “Crash” La Forge slamming into the top Voyage ranks and shaking up the meta in any way? No, but she’s got some positive attributes to make her an attractive Legendary Citation target once you complete her first four stars from a Time Portal Giveaway and Endurance Objective Event.

Just having an ENG Primary and avoiding the CMD/DIP/SUCK booby trap makes her worthwhile as a crew you get essentially for free, since there is a notable dearth of ENG Primary Mega Event Recurring and “giveaway” crew, going back years. Serviceable Voyage power makes use of her plus Skill set and order, and a trio of Collections up front gives her some immediate value in that area. Only one more viable Trait in waiting means most of her Collection value is already locked in, but can you complain too much for a largely free crew?
