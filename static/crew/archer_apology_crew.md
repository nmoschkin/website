Card art showing Scott Bakula's frontula (someone fan me) comes from the episode where Archer's a total dick. Haha, like that narrows it down.

Humbled is viable in the Gauntlet with a trio of decent Proficiencies, but it can be deceiving against walls of OP Exclusives. A single 45% Crit set and almost thirty 25% sets give him some life if you can grab a copy of him early in a playthrough, but for an elderly player he may almost never find a slot amongst your team of five.

One would assume that his handful of viable Traits will catch a Collection or four over time and help offset his Stat rank droopage to keep him in contention as a strong Behold choice.
