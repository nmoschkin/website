Giant Intergalactic Space Probe seeking Spock is not what I was looking for in the personals, but here we are.

Spock is known for his well-established Event empire. Plenty of Events year-to-year supplemented by Traits which also grant him multi-Collection status is value that endures and should keep him afloat as a Behold option, since he has long ago dropped out of daily use contention. Now back to the paper - ooh Tellarite Seeking Zakdorn!
