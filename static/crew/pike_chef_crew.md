Sporting the kind of borderline bouffant that inspires confidence in his sous chefs and kitchen hands, Chef Pike hits about the right level of daily power for a giveaway crew, sporting a passably powerful SCI base, good-yet-not-elite voyage power, and an average of one or two events a year going back to almost the start of the game. So far, so garlic butter. Where he falters is in his less than zesty garnishes - everything is merely good, not quite great. Like a plate of lovely spaghetti choking on an overly generous helping of parmesan cheese, this card lacks statistical flavour, outperformed on every single AM seat it possesses by Reunion Spock and Kirk, and even if you don't have the Dynamic Duo all made up yet, this isn't a skill set you really need help with.

With SNW events yet to truly pan out (so far, all we've had is a string of one-off appetisers), this is a chef who coasts by on charm and personality rather than raw technical skill. No-one's ever truly unhappy to see Pike, to the point where this is the second giveaway he's had this year, but uniqueness is so far where he's struggled, and he's yet to build up the kind of event portfolio where even vanilla variants are welcome on the roster. If you choose to go for the full three course meal and cite his last star, he'll put in work, but if you're on a late game roster, he might end up a frozen dinner sooner rather than later.
