Hanna Barb-Lara is distinctive in that she is a card that is “good for Gauntlet” is not exclusive to being a reward from a particular game mode, and one of the few top 20-rated Gauntlet crew that can be acquired from the Time Portal or Crew Retrieval. 

Unfortunately, she is relatively thinly-Traited, which gives her few chances to put her strong SEC/CMD Proficiencies to good use - with only five Traits she enjoys no 45% or 65% Gauntlet Crit sets, but gets 25% 18 times. 

Despite the few Traits she has, she’s managed to hit a trio of Collections and could snag two more to make it a five spot. Lara gives her value at one and five stars, but there’s a lot of better crew to Fuse.
