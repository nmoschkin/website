Well-ensconced as one of the top desert crew in the game, Desert PG was an early adopter of the “Collection Beast” moniker, and although she’s since been eclipsed by those with six or seven, she still has managed to squeeze every last drop from her Trait list and one hidden show tag to have a quartet.

While unfortunately we are not likely to see Prime or Mirror Georgiou outside her Section 31 movie all that often, her Event chances are not dire - Discovery Mega Events notwithstanding. A solid Behold choice but not an insta-choice anymore, Fuse PG at your leisure and reap her global boost benefits.
