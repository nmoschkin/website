After having his Altair sandwich jock-blocked by a moody and ultra-testosteronized Worf, the Horga'hn-wielding O'Brien looks to reclaim some semblance of satisfaction. But this variant ain't it, Chief. 

Painfully thin on meaningful Traits, O'Brien at least has the good fortune to be considered an honorary Klingon, making him a name to chekov your level-and-freeze list no matter your play style. Once the Spiritual Collection hits someday, giving him a whole two inclusions, his viable Traits will be exhausted.

Seven of Kal'hyah's eight Trait events have had a Faction component so far which is a rate unlikely to continue, but with a four digit (boosted) SEC base in his pocket, he'll earn some shuttle piloting time in the future. Not a special crew by any means, but dependable and gets the job done, like Miles himself.
