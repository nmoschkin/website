Notedly Nancy Hedford is from the first on-screen appearance of Zefram Cochrane, whose actor oddly enough resembles Connor Trinneer strongly (if you don’t believe me, look it up on Memory Alpha!). 

We here at the Big Book still like MED/CMD in any permutation, and especially when the MED comes first and it’s accompanied by some decent Voyage Power. Nancy manages to parlay her Skill set and order into the opportunity to sit on up to seven Antimatter seats on Voyages, and even though MED seats are infrequent on Faction Shuttles and Nancy won’t have any variants, she has a bevy of Traits to snag weekend bonuses. Those Traits also give her immediate and long-term value in terms of Collections; four on debut and anywhere between one and three more.
