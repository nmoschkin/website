Aging better than most 2016 cards have any right to, Miles crashed out of Voyage contention, but he's picked up some Collection value to compensate. One of the very first adopters of the double 1k Base formation, he's maintained a meager, but steady drip of Event bonuses over the years. Always a fan favorite for his nifty suds and duds, O'Brien's guns have lost their rat-a-tat, but he'll still win you over with some precision flying and up to a quintet of Collections before he makes a perfect landing.
