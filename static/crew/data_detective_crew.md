As with most Dahta from his release era (2016-2020), Sherlock Holmes (oh wait, we canâ€™t say that, sorry Estate of Arthur Conan Doyle), I mean Detective Data is a reasonable Legendary Behold choice due to a stuffed Trait list and solid Event chances. Like Brent Spiner playing variants of Dr. Soong and his creations in Trek, Data events keep coming year after year, and look for this variant to hit up to a quintet of Collections before long.
