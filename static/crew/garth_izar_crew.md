"Sometimes I wish I could boldly go where no man's gone before, but I'll probably stay in Aurora." Oh wait...wrong Garth.

He may be a madman, but he's got a point - or rather a few points of interest. Most known as a hammer on your Ships, 400% Instant Damage at six seconds is as good as it gets, and his comes without an Evasion penalty, even though his Attack Boost isn't as potent as others.

There ends Garth's daily use possibilities for most rosters, but his interesting on-screen character has translated to a nice war chest of Traits that grant him multi-Collection status with room for improvement. Those same Traits should show up inconsistently as Event bonuses, but hopefully often enough to give his Shuttle-oriented Skill set something to do on the weekends.
