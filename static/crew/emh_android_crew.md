The Emergency Medical Android spent a long time as a no-brainer choice in Legendary Beholds, on Citation lists, and in the early days of Crew Retrieval he was a common snipe. They do say time is the fire in which daily use crew burn, and the EMA has unfortunately slipped from that august role.

EMA does feature enduring value from his Ship Ability, which is a decent 250% Instant Damage without a Trigger or Use Limit and a +9 to Attack, so if you get a copy of him early on in your playthrough you can use him on Ships until you acquire one of the meta 400% booms.

WRG was gracious enough to Trait the EMA very well; with two current Collections and a ceiling of six, heâ€™s well-above average in that field, and said Traits add to sporadic Doctor variant Events so you can call upon him on the weekend at least once a quarter.
