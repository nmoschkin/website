If there's one thing that Grey's Anatomy has taught me, it's that you can't be a great surgeon without being a massive prick. That being said, Dr. Russell should be the number one MED crew until the end of time.

Her favourable skill set isnâ€™t even worth mentioning for Gauntlet anymore, so until more of her traits turn into Collections, she's hard to justify as a slot-stealer on rosters that need space and instead makes for fine airlock material. Hey Toby! How do you like it when someone plays fast and loose with YOUR life, jerk?
