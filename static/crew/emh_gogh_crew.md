Dating back to biblical times and the legendary Samson, a man's mane has always been the seat of power. The courageous crown, the sagacious skull, the notable noggin. Throughout history, from Zeus to StarsAndGarters, a powerful pelt has imbued its owner with the strength to conquer feats that no mere mortal could conceive of.

So it is with Doctor Van Joe. Made of space-age holographic fibers, Doc's duster was designed to repel anything; rain, wind, snow, and especially young women. And so Van Gogh has channeled that Sickbay solitude into his mastery of Engineering and Science.

His decidedly televangelistic hairdo comes replete with strong ENG and SCI Bases, but unfortunately heâ€™s aged out of daily use on Voyages. A quartet of Collections, plus an additional viable untapped Trait in tow, gives DVG lasting value, and the Event pedigree of the Doctor plus ancillary Trait bonuses will let him pitch in when his name is called on the weekends.
