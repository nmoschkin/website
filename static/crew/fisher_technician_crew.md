Lucky to have debuted with any semblance of usability at all, that has begun drying up for Fisher. Once a part-time Voyager with reasonable Antimatter chances, Fisherâ€™s subpar raw power has seen him drop from use there on many rosters while almost any new crew approximating his Skill set should offer better stats.

With a very tenuous link to relevance via Traits, this is a card to safely avoid in Beholds unless you have several stars gathered on him already.
