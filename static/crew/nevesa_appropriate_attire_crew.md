I bet you didn’t think we’d get a second Nevesa variant, did you? Joining the likes of fellow podium crew like Obrist, Academy Speech Burnham and Officiant Kirk, Nevesa is the latest Legendary Romulan to join the game on the heels of Nanclus, making it possible for you to staff that pesky Romulan Antimatter seat on Voyages with a strong enough crew for it to make a difference.

Yet another crew with a Primary/Secondary Skill stack with some permutation of CMD, DIP, or SCI, at least this Romantic Romulan has the good grace to include an ENG kicker as her Tertiary Skill, elevating her right away over the overstuffed ranks of CMD/DIP/SUCK. Viable Voyage power on debut makes her an attractive choice for some Legendary Citations, but once she’s in the Time Portal 12-18 months from debut you’ll still have her Trait list to fall back on; a trio of Collections upon unboxing and enough viable Traits to give her a possible seven-spot.

Instant Damage crew are a dime a dozen, but with a 400% Instant Damage Ship Ability coming alive at 8s, she might be an option for certain Arena builds, or for a newer player just finding their way in Skirmish and Arena.
