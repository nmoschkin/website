Looking quizzical, Christopher Pike is wondering why he, as the star of the show, is a Super Rare, while his junior officers get to be Legendary crew. Released in an Event with a Galaxy component, you can acquire all four copies of Orion Hurricane Pike and Immortalize him for the Objective Event of your choice, or get a plus one on his three Stat-Boosting Collections. An interesting Skill Set including CMD and MED (in that order) does make him viable on early game Voyages, and Pike is a bankable Event name with Strange New Worlds the only “Nu Trek” show still running. For the early game player again, he drops a gob of Crit Bonus on you at 8s so he’s a solid “Ardra-lite”:™: option on Ships.
