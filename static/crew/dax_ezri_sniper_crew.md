One of the top Rare Crew in the game given what you need a crew of her Rarity to do: qualify for Cadet Missions. Pew Pew Ezri has dual weekend Cadet Mission eligibility due to being non-human and female, and her Bases and Proficiencies allow her to both contribute on Voyages AND Gauntlet in the early game. Devote resources to Fully Equip and Fully Fuse her as youâ€™re able, due to her utility.
