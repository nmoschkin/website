It’s an older crew sir, but it checks out. I was just about to clear him. Ol’ Holonovel Doctor from game launch has found a nice niche as a Event/Collection specialist, with a strong enough Base to ride Event Shuttles when variant and Trait bonuses give him weekend work. The usual EMH Traits plus one should give him a nice ceiling of four Collections when he finishes playing through the whole course.
