At the Academy, Lavelle was voted Most Likely To Have Too Many Capital Letters In His Name, so that yearbook entry seems to have aged well. It's also good that Boimler 1.0 has some Great White North lineage, because he's going to need that +15 frost protection buff for all the time he'll be spending in cryo.

A strong DIP Base will let you consider Sam as a thaw candidate if/when thereâ€™s a Gambler Event, and the rest of his Traits are pretty much DOA, so he might be the poster child for Finish, Freeze and Forget.
