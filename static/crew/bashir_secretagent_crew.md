Bondshir has faded into obscurity on Voyages and in the Gauntlet, so his best remaining opportunity for daily use is for solving Nodes in Fleet Boss Battles. While he’s thawed for Node-hunting, you’ll be rewarded with a consistent Event clip (four plus in the last four calendar years). 

The true reason to spend capital to Immortalize this crew is for his Trait set, which has given him four star-boosting Collections to date, a fun Vanity Collection, plus enough left in the tank for two more in coming years.
