A slightly goofy, endearing, dancing Jean-Luc was certainly feeling his oats after a trip to the Ba'ku planet and it’s a nicer choice for a variant than another stoic pose. Unfortunately, his best attribute is stifled in a big way moving forward.

Despite the pejorative label “glorified 2-Skiller” applied to him in the past for his tiny SCI Proficiency, Mambo sat atop the DIP/CMD Gauntlet ranks for years and could throw his weight around with a top three DIP roll. Nowadays, you’ll find plenty of walls of the overpowered Exclusive Balok who is simply the more versatile and popular choice and can match Mambo even when he’s at a Crit disadvantage. Picard’s Gauntlet ability is still a significant boon for new players grabbing his first star and he has reasonable power with elevated Crit sets, but you may have to dump a few Merits in competitive Gauntlets in order to find him room to maneuver.

The value is spotty elsewhere. His three viable Traits only provide blips of Event value and not much in the way of Collections. Still, an above average power level in a few areas and the long term relevance of Picard’s brand name make him a crew you should be happy to see in most cases.
