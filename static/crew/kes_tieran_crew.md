One of Jennifer Lien’s best acting jobs on Voyager was not in fact playing milquetoast Kes, but in playing sociopathic dictator Tieran inhabiting the body of the former. This crew has unfortunately aged from being a standard-bearer for a Super Rare Crew (big CMD Base, strong Voyager) to a Finish and Freeze candidate. One day when her three or four viable Traits snag a Collection, you’ll remember this crew for a moment.
