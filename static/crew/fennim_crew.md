"*unintelligible noises*" - Wise words from Fennim. I think he's trying to tell us to rescue him from the Think Tank, but this is one fish you may want to throw back. 

Fennim has a unique cacophony of Traits that as of now have granted him inclusion in a trio of Collections, and lo and Behold he could go five-for-five if fortune further favors him. Choose him from Beholds or Retrieve him if you’re running low on Traitier or stronger crew, but don’t spend too much time or resources on this weirdo.
