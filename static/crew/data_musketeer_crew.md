When a lot of players look at Data, they might see a 2-skiller with nothing fancy about him besides his fantastic outfit, but Muskie's better than that. Niche (read:new player) Arena Accuracy meets a SEC base mere points off the lead for Super Rare Datas for spot work on early-to-midgame rosters. But as a one stop Collection shop, Musketeer Data may not have hit his peak yet. Triple stat-boosting Collections, four additional Traits which very well could get lucky, and maybe an outside shot at a whimsical vanity Collection. Even players who are looking for consistent, daily usage from their Super Rare crew should devote the roster space to collect copies.
