Time Loop Mudd is everything you might want in a Super Rare if you’re out of the early game; a strong Trait buffet and the Events to go with them. A quartet of Collections as it stands and a few more untapped to bring his prospective grand total to seven or more, he’s often the Dwight choice in a Super Rare Behold these days.
