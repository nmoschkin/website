🎵Leck, you've got me on my knees.
Leck, I'm begging, darling, please.
Leck, won't you ease my worried mind?🎵

Well crap, I guess that doesn’t work for every crew now, does it? You know what does work for this crew though? Leck’s solid-for-a-Super Rare SEC Base and therefore passable Voyage score! Let’s face it though, even younger rosters and Nightmare Mode™ enjoyers can and will do better for Crew of this Rarity, but if you find yourself competing in his Event you shouldn’t pass up the chance for a “free” four copies. Mid-game and older players can take solace in the fact that, although he only has a couple of Stat-Boosting Collections for now, Leck is sitting on somewhat of a Latinum mine of potential future ones, making this Ferengi a wise investment indeed.
