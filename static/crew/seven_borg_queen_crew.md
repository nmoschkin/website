Context is for kings. If this were various points along 2018 or 2019, Seven would be a skippable Event crew. Two years after her debut in the Honor Hall, Borg Queen Seven, whose main attribute would seem to have been Voyage power, has aged terribly due to Power Creep.

She has little to no value for Ship Battles or in Gauntlet, and her Event chances have been strong between Traits and variant bonuses, bringing a powerful Seven CMD base along the way.

Even her Traits have only sprung forth a trio of Collections, with perhaps one more to come.  For an Honor Hall Crew, which will cost you 100,000 Honor for the first star, and 4 Legendary Citations to complete, she may be a poor choice of that currency outlay.
