CMD/MED is in demand from the early game until the late game, and Nurse Paris is the earliest opportunity you have to get some for Voyages. Paris used to be the top Uncommon CMD base, but he’s been beaten down by four, count ‘em, four, newer crew. Complete Paris at your leisure and look for his Traits to pay out in new Collection spots.
