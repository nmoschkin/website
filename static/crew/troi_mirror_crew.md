The age of everybody's favorite Dominatroix has disqualified her from Voyages, but a worthwhile mix of Proficiency power, Skill set, and eclectic Traits still make her a fine Gauntlet option. Capping out at 25% Crit is a bummer, but her MED-led Skill pairings very rarely face walls of MED/DIP or MED/SEC, leaving the door open for her to 2-for-1 or just outright overpower other crew's Secondary and Tertiary rolls.

Unfortunately that Trait set hasn't translated so well to Collections, but at least gives her a fighting chance to compete against the Garaks and Spocks of the world while instead supplementing a mostly rock solid Event history in combination with Troi variant weekends. Inquisitor does derive much of her value from the first star, but that also makes her a strong early game choice for newer players and gives you something to do with her while she slowly builds toward five stars.
