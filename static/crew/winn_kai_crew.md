Walk with the Prophets, my child - right over to the time portal to claim your free copy of CMD/DIP/SCI with acceptable voyage metrics and minimum three collections, which is, by now, the rubber stamped and approved way to immortalise beloved actors who have unfortunately passed away. If I were WRG, I too would definitely find it tricky to justify MED or ENG for the notorious Winn Adami, well known for being damaging to other people and military installations just by coming into contact with them, and while we may have dodged the Amanda Grayson problem of hilarious SEC skills for people doing threatening things like holding books or being Louise Fletcher, just . . . this skill set. 

Do you want a crazy, obscure metric? Of course you do, you're reading the Big Book. Kai Winn is the fourth best CMD/DIP/SCI voyager in the game, at time of writing. Not amongst various different permutations of the skill set, oh no - there are no less than three better voyagers with this exact order of skills in the game right now. At time of writing, it makes up nearly 10% of the top 50 voyagers. To reiterate that is ONLY CMD/DIP/SCI. To say nothing of DIP/CMD/SCI, or SCI/DIP/CMD, or SCI/CMD/DIP, which doubles that figure.

This is Homer Simpson being fed double donuts in Hell levels of skill set oversaturation at this point. It's a good thing you're getting it for free, because Kahless knows that you really don't want to be pulling packs or working your tush off in events for it. Winn does at least come with some non-standard traits to make her relevant in places where her other copy-paste fellows aren't, with Villain and Bajoran seats in particular lacking for varied, high performing coverage these days, and the collection profile has a sunny outlook. Just expect her expiry date to be somewhere between milk and a Lemming when other, more interesting cards come along.
