Bone Digger Q (maybe needs a motorcycle with flames and some badass skull helmet) is plenty capable without a third Skill and excels in the areas you expect from a 2-Skiller; Events and Collections, and fertile Traits for more of the same.

While unsurprisingly not the only Costumed member of the Continuum in game, it's always advisable to grab multiple Collection spots with a single crew. And a few Traits which have already supplemented his Event work could also hit in both areas going forward. John de Lancie's Q variants aren't overflowing with SCI options and edging out the hybrid Data Q for those seats helps make Archaeologist a worthwhile thaw candidate depending on the bonus size of his Events.
