Hello?  Is it a great Romulan voyager you’re looking for?

You’ve missed the boat unfortunately, because J’Vini isn’t it. A month prior to her release, you could have had Sela in Shadow, solidly released in the top 30 voyagers, to fill that neglected antimatter seat. Or, you could have spent some quatloos for Quack Quack Elnor in the UberKampaign with his big power and sure-to-poorly-age CDS skill set. Or, 10 months ago you could have gotten a nice Security Laris, who is still “voyage viable” even given the developers’ Warp 9.975 power creep lately.

But, let’s descend from our ivory tower for a minute. If you’re not an “elderly player” (copyright WRG_Ben), and don’t have the 3 aforementioned crew, J’Vini could easily ride your voyages for a year or two in that Romulan antimatter seat.

The skill set’s not bad… the SCI kicker helps her not be entirely DOA, as if she were in the oft-maligned CDS triplet.

Ok, now for the good, and J’Vini has quite a few positive aspects that buoy her extended value.

Four collections out of the box, including the newly-minted Star Trek: Discovery collection! 4 is about the new baseline for a “good” collection crew, and as far as additional traits go, there is one “goldilocks” viable one for another collection (Scoundrel), two that are on the lower side of viability for being very niche (Qowat Milot and Xenoanthropology) and two that may be just too big to be viable, or have too much overlap (Brutal and Telepath). Notably, no HFS!

Did I mention she has a big ol’ SEC base? Well, she does. NEW NUMBER ONE, baby!  Sorry, High Roller Sisko. You had a good run! J’Vini will hop onto SEC and SEC/CMD requisition shuttles every Faction weekend, plus she’s got the traits to catch bonus seating a few times a year if not more.
 
Last, but absolutely not least, is her ship ability, and boy oh boy, it's a good one! She is an improved Killy clone with 6s init 400% boom, lasting 2 seconds longer for all your Attack boost needs. Still not limitless, but triggerless!  Might want a J’Vini for your arena and skirmish set up!
