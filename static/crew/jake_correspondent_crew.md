BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!

Solely a Collection/Event crew at this point, Jakeo has long run away from daily use and has skidded to a halt with three Collections, including the difficult Writer set, but he’s likely tapped out there. Ostensibly main cast crew, Jake has not gotten a variant bonus since 2021 but this card has TWO features, so who knows if we’ll get a third run of his event in the recent future.
