Whether you appreciate obnoxiously large art props on your bridge crew photos, good and pretty cats, love loafers, or just want those funny numbers attached to the crew, this Data offers something for everyone. 

The Professor is stranded on CMD/DIP/SUCK island, awash in skill set flotsam from the retread, re-print crew surrounding him. Even without his unique skill order among all crew (!), having something other than those very common Skill sets instantly differentiates him among the elite Voyage names. With fabulous and so far-enduring power and taking advantage of MED’s shallow Antimatter pool for easy Trait match seating, Data should be near the top of everyone’s ‘Voyages made’ tally for quite a while. 

Data’s popularity and strong Bases also make him a worthy weekend investment. A great SCI (and CMD) option for all his foreseeable bonus avenues, you can lock him in for a few Faction Events per year as well as intermittent non-bonus and daily Shuttle seating. He isn’t as girthily-Traited as some other variants, but he’s found a duo of Stat-boosting Collections and a seat in the Pet People Collection, which will unlock cousin Data and Spot one day.
