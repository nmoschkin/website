Data’s Mom is showing her age, falling out of daily use on Voyages and in Gauntlet where she made her name for years. In Gauntlet, she’s one of the Triple A options (baseball reference for those not familiar) so she won’t likely be included on your team more than once or twice a month when her 45% Crit set comes up. Newer players, if you luck into her, feel free to use her to win a few Exclusives which may push her out of rotation.

An eclectic group of Traits have given her long-term value to the tune of three current Collections, but only one likely one left to hit. Still a solid Legendary Behold choice, Juliana is no longer the insta-pick she once was, but still is aging gracefully.
