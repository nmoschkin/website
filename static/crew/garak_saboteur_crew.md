Aged out of daily use by now, Sabo Garak is still a worthwhile Legendary Behold selection if you are in need of a 400% Instant Damage crew for your Skirmish/Arena set up, or are chasing long-term investments for Collections. Garak should reasonably top out at a six pack of Collections while only having one now, making him one of the best investments in the game. Featured in an odd Faction/Skirmish Event which has just been rerun for the second time, you might find yourself acquiring more stars for him via a rerererun before long.
