Little more than Collection fodder, Reg's best and perhaps only shot at 'real' use will come in his lone 65% Gauntlet. Paired with an underrepresented ENG roll, he has a shot to pick up a win here or there, even though walls of The Red Angel likely await him. 

Beyond that, he has only a single Trait that's not comically overstuffed, which limits his opportunity at value expansion. Barclay's Beholds will often be a simple equation; if his Collection count is higher than that Aleek-Om or Karyn Archer across from him, take the Collections.
