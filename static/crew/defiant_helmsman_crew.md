It’s about the cones… I mean Traits. Helmsman (Ben) Wyatt has four Traits, three of which are almost certainly unviable for Collections, and while he has two serviceable Bases, they likely need his all-too-common Traits to hit on the weekend in order to pitch in on Shuttles. Without any variants to pitch in, the only other thing of note is a 400% Instant Damage Ship Ability, behind a Position Trigger, without any Limits, so if you want to figure out a fun Arena/Skirmish team with a Position Ship, he could be your guy. Send more calzones!
