Captain Shaw, self-proclaimed grease monkey that he is, once again joins us without any Engineering skill to speak of. Befitting of his namesake heroics, however, he does sport a mighty SEC Base; yet another crew in the ever interchangeable upper ranks of that particular skill.

Fret not, because with the grit and determination befitting of his character, this Shaw will claw his way aboard a Voyage or two when heâ€™s not busy shuttling for you. One of the better options for his Triplet, especially when it comes to his many trait specific Anti-Matter bonus seats, those of you willing to invest the time and resources into immortalising him quickly will enjoy a bit of a boost in that particular game mode. Additionally, while he does sport a 2 shot limit on his Ship Ability, his 400% Instant Damage comes online at 6 seconds, making him a great candidate for Arena, notably thanks to a far meatier Crit Bonus compared to his contemporaries. Sadly, this is the kind of crew whose use will be wiped out by newer, shinier crew in the future, but the investment could still pay off for patient players as he stands a strong chance of gaining four Collections on top of the rather pedestrian one that he debuts with.
