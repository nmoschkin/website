In the minisode that Craft hails from, Zora, the Discovery's computer gone all Blade Runner because it's been left parked in a nebula for a thousand years (don't ask), found him interesting enough to fall in love. If only this version of him were half as fascinating. If only he felt more...hand-crafted.

Already a name with multiple Collections, Craft has a respectable ceiling in that area, and his Traits have done some heavy lifting lately, giving him a double handful of Events in 2022, but almost bupkis in 2023 as it stands, giving credence to the unpredictability of Trait-based Event forecasting.
