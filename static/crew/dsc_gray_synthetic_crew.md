Even without the potential of a hands-on-hips collection (scrapped due to the high percentage of Janeway variants they’d have to include), Gray’s Traits will look to do the heavy lifting for his value moving forward.

Four of his five viable Traits have appeared as weekend bonuses already, while anything but Starfleet and Federation are legitimate Collection possibilities as well.

Not an auspicious release for a character that was hyped up via player vote, but Gray is all but guaranteed to pop up as a name to know when his Traits afford him that notoriety.
