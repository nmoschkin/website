A little Tig, a little Discovery goofiness, and a heap o’ Traits are the recipe for a Super Premium Campaign crew aimed at wallets everywhere. A (small) step down in Voyage ability amidst a run of power hitters, Reno still holds her own there with a heady Antimatter rate and strong Skill order that may as well be one of a kind. She’ll age out of Voyages gracefully, but there’s more long-term value afoot.

And as you might have gleaned from the thoughtful and innovative Campaign announcement(s), she’s been known to have a Collection or two after work to relax. With a value floor and ceiling both above average in that area, it’s some surefire kryptonite aimed at veteran players looking for reasons to cut back on spending. Even as her daily efficacy slips over time, Collections and a Mega Event-fueled Event history should keep her in Crew Retrieval contention.
