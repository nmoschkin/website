Deciding he had more of a purpose and place in life back in the 21st Century, Rios stayed behind and was written out of ever appearing in Picard Season 3, er I mean, made a difference!

Another place he could be making a difference is on your Ship Battle roster! If you don’t have some of the gated-behind-game-feature crew such as Vox, Omet’iklan, or Demo Man Scotty, Cristóbal just may be the speedy Crit Bonus crew you’re looking for! Boosting you here with +15,000 (or more if you wait for it to charge up, which you shouldn’t), as well as +9 Accuracy, while remaining active 44% of the time puts him in rare company. He also debuts with a rather meaty ENG Base, possibly useful should you not have the aforementioned Demo Man, but not a game changer due to the general lack of ENG seats in shuttles and Faction Events. To top it off, he boasts Four Stat-Boosting Collections with perhaps up to Three more in the future (as long as he doesn’t get in to any bar fights in Morocco before then…).
