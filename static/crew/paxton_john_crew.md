A strong Trait set is the grease that oils this particular Prickmobile. Paxton is littered with properties esoteric enough to snag possible Event or Collection value (Survivalist having provided both so far) while still having the good fortune of hitting a half dozen Antimatter bonuses on Voyages. His power there would be adequate for a number of skill sets, but as a CMD/DIP/SUCK and with the increased competition that comes along with that, you'll most often need to employ him with a Trait match. 

Absent Traits, his edges are somewhat rounded; not offering elite value in any one area. He shouldn't top any Citation or Crew Retrieval lists, but as a fan favorite character actor across so many franchises, he has enough facets to make him worth the investment on the right rosters. At this point you would be investing energy in Paxton for Collection value, and with a rich set of Traits which has so far yielded four, with up to two more more than likely, your investment will likely pay off (like Paxtonâ€™s Gambler trait)!
