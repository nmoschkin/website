You gotta admit the hedgehog looks pretty snazzy in the security gold. An Elite voyager on release, Tac Neelix has finally fallen from use on most rosters in that aspect. 

His SEC base ranks well among his various Traits and variants and he's already a multi-Collection offering with the possibility to add to that count, if WRG starts to introduce Collections tailored to Neelixâ€™s common Traits like Chef and Ambassador.
