If Chakotay would just check the time on the pocketwatch he is holding, he would see that his time is up (and has been for some time) as a useful crew. While he does wield a strong DIP Base (gift giving is a diplomatic skill surely) for when his name is called for variant and the occasional Trait Event, he has very slim Collection value which leaves him on the outside looking in most of the time.
