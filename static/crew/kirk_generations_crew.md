Nexus Kirk, wielding both an ax and above-average Gauntlet Proficiencies for a Super Rare, deserves some early Behold consideration while you build your crew with Legendaries that will eventually replace him. Kirk Events are frequent but this variant may not have the Bases to warrant a thaw from Cryostasis, so slowly Fuse him up and enjoy his two to three Collection ceiling.
