He might live in Cryostasis while weâ€™re all Pine-ing away for another Kirk variant Fusion crew to Humpty Dumpty James Tiberius back together again, but Kirk Event bonuses are as constant as the Northern Star and Evil's Shuttle-friendly Skill set is the perfect accompaniment.

There's little other meat on the bone for this 2-Skiller and his Collection value has a Trait limit to it, but having three viable Traits keeps him floating above Tier 10, and should be a name for veterans to acquire as his weekend work will help you out with big Faction Event pushes.
