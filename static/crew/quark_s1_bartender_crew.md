Infant rosters (and Nightmare Mode enthusiasts) will love Quarkâ€™s Shuttle and Voyage metrics, but like all Common crew these are easily outclassed by higher Rarity options as time goes on. Requiring a couple handfuls of Faction Items to Immortalize, he may be a bit expensive early on, but keep an open mind whenever you see him show up! Quark variants are usually Traity and this penchant has already paid off, with perhaps more Collections to come from what remains untapped on his list.
