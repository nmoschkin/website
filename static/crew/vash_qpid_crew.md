Maid Marian is SchrÃ¶dinger's crew. The Big Book knocked her for a long time for being a "process over results" crew, which is and can be true. Yet WRG's seismic shift to Traits and Collections also probably means that Vash ends up as a more valuable card years later than she was at release. 

Those two areas are her only points of interest and could end up as duds or gold mines. Vash's Event history is zero or ðŸ’¯ year to year, but six non-HFS traits is about as good as it gets for crew and should invite her into a few more Mega Events in the future. Similarly for Collections, the sky's the limit and helps make her a worthwhile dart throw Behold choice if you're not enticed by the other options.
