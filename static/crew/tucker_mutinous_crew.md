Maybe.

Maybe you adore “Enterprise”. The recent shine WRG has given to the oft-forgotten names has included a Mega and a Campaign. Now, out of the blue, more love is being shown to some characters that haven’t seen a new variant in years. Enter now the latest offering from 2004, and a big win for Trip fans (all 7 of you!) that have waited since 2019 for a new Legendary version to grace us with his mutinous presence.

Trip simply brings a pretty good unboosted Voyage score & rank to the table, and a great combo of DIP/ENG/SEC. True enough that recent Portal Updates have brought many strong options of those skills to all players, but few have seven Antimatter matches. Trip also flexes his traitorous muscles with four Collections, and two waiting in the wings.

True, his Arena ability is not worth getting infected with weird alien egg neurotoxin, but the rest of his use is worth putting your Captain at phaser-point for — or ranking in a Galaxy event.

Well, maybe.
