Surface level ranks for Sign Language Tuvok AKA Dikembe Mutombo Tuvok AKA Onevok AKA Hook 'Em Horns Tuvok AKA 'What are you doing in such a filthy uniform?' Tuvok are not impressive. So despite a fairly uncommon skill set at the Super Rare level, you'll want to take advice from his Arena ability and play the long game. His value blooms post-cryo in the form of quadruple Collections and in being one of two serviceable DIP options for Tuvok shuttles (sorry, Tuvix), as well as continuing to cultivate at least one more future Collection via the Counselor Trait.
