The Age of Animated Voyagers continues. With the love being spread between TAS and Lower Decks, WRG is on a spree that shows no signs of stopping soon. The latest entry in the always welcome ENG Primary Club has the distinction of not being in a 6 pack (don’t do 6 packs kids), and it gets better from there. Befitting of the inimitable Jeffrey Combs, AGIMUS stands above his peers thanks to Skill Order, Raw Power, and Traits. A Cite-on-Sight character for anyone who spent the time tapping away to earn at least one copy, he’ll be a mainstay on your Voyages for years to come. Pair that with the #3 ENG base and “Lord” AGIMUS should see plenty of use on Event Shuttles as well if he’s not too busy trying to assemble another fleet of murder drones. His 400% Instant Damage Ship Ability isn’t as shiny as it may seem at first glance as there are plenty of faster and trigger-free candidates out there, but we can’t let this Self-Aware Megalomaniacal Computer get too powerful, can we?
