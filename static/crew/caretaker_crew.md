Like other Exclusive crew, there's a bit extra to unpack about Banjo Man. After six plus years in the game, he has finally aged out of Voyages, but he had a little more life than usual given his ENG/MED unicorn Skill combination.

Then we come to the buried lede; Gauntlet. His #1 ENG Proficiency isn't just good, it's stupid good. The only usable Gauntleteer to bring an ENG roll within a country mile of Caretaker's is fellow Exclusive The Red Angel, with other names below him including a 1-skill crew and a Super Rare. That monster ENG roll gives him ownership of a handful of ranked Gauntlet pairs as well as the top ENG/MED pair by a double digit margin. Suffice it to say, he's a banger. His biggest weaknesses are rarely exceeding 25% crit and Red Angel infringing on a few of his pairs, but with such a huge ENG and ENG/MED lead over the competition, your best option against any Caretaker walls is usually 50 merits. 

Caretaker’s Traits, outside of giving him crit sets in the Gauntlet, have finally paid off due to Collection-mania, and now he possesses three additional Stat-boosting Collections to go with his mandatory inclusion on “A New Challenger Approaches”, with room for perhaps one or more to come. Gauntlet Beholds will now give you a greater chance to obtain or Fuse this fantastic crew, so grab him if you can!
