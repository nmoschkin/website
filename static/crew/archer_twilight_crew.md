We’d like to quibble about a Tertiary Skill that should be ENG to fit this particular crew, but it really doesn’t matter since he’s dead on Voyages anyways, as dead as Earth was in this particular timeline. (oops, spoilers for a 20 year old show)

Average at best in most other respects, Archer’s strength sits at the helm of Shuttles. Great Base metrics and seat availability give him plenty of work straight out of the box, but with a DIP Primary rank that is guaranteed to sink like a stone, you will, like Twilight Archer, soon forget why you bothered to Fuse him up in the first place.
