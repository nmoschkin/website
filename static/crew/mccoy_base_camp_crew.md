One has to wonder what McCoy is seeing through that ViewMaster circa 1985. Is he seeing a long-term value for this variant, or a quick decline followed by obscurity and relegation to the Cryostasis Vault? 

There was a day when a player would pay almost anything for a little MED and CMD, and while that is still somewhat true, McCoy’s duo is his bottom two Skills so the value isn’t all there, but there’s still some power to go around. A quintet of Anti-Matter seat matches will help him find rides on Voyages for awhile, and those some Traits give him four debut Collections, but unfortunately no room for more later. McCoy Events have dried up a bit lately, but his Traits have given him plenty of work instead, and that Big DIP Base™ will play there. 

If Fleet Boss Battles are your thing, check out his 20% Hull Repair chops with a 20s cycle if you are somehow missing the 25% HR crew.
