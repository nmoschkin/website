MED/CMD on the behold screen is sure to elicit a Bateman-esque 'Oooo', but the power lets Troi down big time. An early game gauntlet option thanks to a good skill set and a few 45% trait combos, Troi should help you navigate that part of the game for a while, but she hits like a wiffle bat compared to many Legendary options. Now that the blindly thrown Collection dart has landed on Betazoid she has some added value, with Counselor and Empath potential additions down the line as well.
