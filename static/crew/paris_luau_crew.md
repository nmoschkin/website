Imagine that Episode 10 Rare Reward Quinn and former Campaign crew Determined Paris had a love child and he came out wearing a really cool shirt, sipping on a pineapple.

Luau’s trajectory was always self-evident and the power that earned him his own quarters on debut isn’t quite enough to stand out in the worst Voyage Skill set in the game by a mile. Having had his Skill set, Skill order, and several Antimatter Traits cannibalized by one Mega Event Recurring and Giveaway crew after another, Paris may not be a card you want to chase from star one if you weren’t playing for his four copy giveaway.

That’s not to say he’s dead in the water, but if mulling a Legendary Behold or Citation investment, you should already be mentally pivoting to his Event and Collection values. Paris is a typically reliable Event name, but his Traits have offered only token help on the weekends and in the Collection tab. Paris has found himself a surprise Vanity Collection via Convergence Day, but that still only lifts his Collection ceiling to four.
