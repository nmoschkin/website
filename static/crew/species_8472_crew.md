8472's offerings are at odds. His first Star holds the bulk of his value, stars 2-4 are essentially useless, and his last star unlocks the only other thing you should want him for; Collections. While it's possible we see his Collection count added to alongside an introductory Mega Event, Shuttles really shouldn't be much of a consideration when selecting this crew.

His highs are high, but he sports too many handicaps outside of his Proficiencies to be worth a five star investment until we see that Collection count grow.
