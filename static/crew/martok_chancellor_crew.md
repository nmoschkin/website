Name dropping Martok and a fiver might get you a delicious chicken sandwich, but unbeknownst to most is that Martok has hit on at least one variant Event bonus in five of six calendar years. With a half dozen other Event-able Traits, he is a lesser-known name who could end up driving your Shuttles more often than you'd expect. 

Chancellor Martok offers nothing in terms of Voyages, Gauntlet, or Arena, but there is little more you can ask for from a four year old crew than a thicc Trait list. Keep one eye on his Collection total as it is sure to grow in time to a maximum of seven, which is a 100% coverage of his Traits.
