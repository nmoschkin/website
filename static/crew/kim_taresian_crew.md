When your character washes up on the beach in an RPG and you grab a rusty pipe to go fight some crabs - hereâ€™s Taresian Kim!

There are three points of interest here: Arena Evasion for the early game, fairly consistent Events to highlight mediocre Bases, and a few viable Traits that might hit the Collection lotto at some point down the line. As of this writing he's one of the easier Super Rares to ignore, but has a path to value should his Traits become featured material in the future.
