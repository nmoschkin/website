Well, it’s not Q’s candy corn version of the future, but Wesley Crusher’s all grown up and ready to get an A.

To do so, he’s going to need to leverage his traits to provide an edge. On voyages, Tarka debuts as the top power option for his skill set, even though his raw numbers aren’t particularly impressive. Still, in combination with some uncommon traits, he’ll find plenty of odd trait matches for you and is a plus voyager overall.

Similarly in events, his traits have snagged enough bonuses post-Disco to earn him occasional play on the weekends. With his well-known Wesley traits in hand like Prodigy and Scoundrel, we’re likely to see Tarka’s collection count rise as well. Though not an outstanding option in any area, you can expect to utilize this crew from time to time across a few different areas.
