Noted turd pile Soong has been a punchline for years. That's it. That's his note.

Ok, ok...we here at the Big Book love to remind you to follow the traits, and Soong does have three or four viable ones. But until such time as they start popping up in Megas, Faction Events, or new Collections, all heâ€™s going to do is give you a bump up in the relatively simple Stat-Boosting Daystrom Award Collection.
