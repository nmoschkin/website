Unsurprisingly, there's more to this simple tailor than meets the eye. Poor daily use numbers across the board with a Skill set described the same is disguising his powder keg Collection value.

Already a good Collection piece, Garak's list of potential future Collections is longer than the list of foreign dignitaries he's killed. In fact, that list (seven) will probably only be shorter by the time you're reading this and his tangible value will have grown.

But if you really can't be bothered with WRG's pressure to catch 'em all, Garak's fistful of 45%+ Crit Gauntlets certainly makes him usable, if not formidable, from time to time. And a glance at his Event history shows that whether relying on variant Events of the past or jumping into the Trait era of the now, Garak should have tons of chances to snatch Event bonuses to go with his Shuttle-friendly Skill set.
