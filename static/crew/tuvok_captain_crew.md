We’ve already seen crew that tick the Gauntlet, Collection, Events, Shuttles, and Voyages boxes from this Convergence Day Objective Event, but where does this leave Captain Tuvok? Why, he’s the one you want on your Ships! A carbon copy (but not a Changeling copy) of T’Pring as Spock, who was only available in a Tuesday Pack, everyone’s favorite former half of Tuvix has +20000 to Crit Bonus, Cycling at 18s and a big Attack Boost, not to mention another +900 Crit Bonus from Passives. So, consider saving yourself 100,000 Honor for Vox from the Honor Hall, don’t wait for T’Pring as Spock to hit the Time Portal later in 2024, and snag Tuvok from the OE, Cite him up, and don’t look back!
