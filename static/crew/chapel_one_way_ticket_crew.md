The game’s third Voyage-Exclusive Legendary Crew, filling out your pie-in-the-sky Voyage Beholds along with fellow unobtainable crew VD Chuckles and Badmiral Black, here’s One Way Ticket Chapel! 

Blasting her way into the Voyage loot tables only a few scenes after she and M’Benga inject futuristic PEDs and beat down some Klingons hand to hand, she’s not hitting dingers a la Mark McGwire. But Jess Bush’s Chapel is tugging at your heartstrings and seducing the Voyage Retrieval Tokens right out of your Inventory as you launch max length Voyage after max length Voyage for just a *glimpse* of her!

If you can get a copy quickly and pass over Gauntlet Pillar Black in favor of her, and Immortalize, she’ll be a beacon on your Voyages for a while, helping you to find many more Voyage Beholds (surely!), with a strong and capable Skill set of MED/SEC/DIP along with enough power to wield it properly. She’s a refresh of longtime juggernaut Mok’bara Crusher, and even has a junior version of Crusher’s Ship Ability (after all, Crusher is a Doctor and Chapel a Nurse), with a 20% Hull Repair plus an Attack Boost, Cycling every 24s. Chapel is also the strongest Nurse Voyager that can actually sit in the new MED Antimatter Voyage seat, so that’s a plus.
