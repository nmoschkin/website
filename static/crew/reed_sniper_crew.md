Like his name would suggest, Sniper Reed has been lying in wait, biding his time until the Klingons arrive…uh, til he has any use in this game. Now it’s time for him to take his shot.

Boasting a Triggerless 200% Instant Damage at 6s, Malcolm finds his niche in the spam-worthy Normal difficulty of Fleet Boss Battles. It’s not much, but it’s honest work. Long term, he could find himself in a trio of Stat-Boosting Collections, but until then he’s both bland AND British.
