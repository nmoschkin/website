Long ago, Pah-wraith Keiko staffed every CMD daily Shuttle and somehow, flabbergastingly, sat atop the CMD Base rankings. Her time at the summit of those ratings has ended and there’s little left to make her an attractive crew outside of two likely Collection Traits which are yet to hit. CMD Shuttle seats are still extremely numerous, so if you manage to get her Immortalized she’ll likely ride requisition Faction Event Shuttles with aplomb.
