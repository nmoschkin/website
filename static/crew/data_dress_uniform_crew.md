Stepping out from the Troi-Riker wedding in Star Trek: Nemesis, here comes Dress Uniform Data! Two weeks in a row we have new crew cards with amazing art who come from scenes in which they belt out a tune to everyone’s surprise (Devious Duet Jurati), but unfortunately Data is not the world-beater that Jurati is. He does, however, have his charms!

A quick musing on art… it’s hard to believe this game features, from the same film, this variant, and then Nemesis Sacrifice Data, who does Brent Spiner few favors.

Data debuts a bit low on the voyage ranks for a Super Rare at about rank 100, so he probably won’t do much work for a player there except in the early game. Most new Super Rares have been debuting far higher, so he’ll be eclipsed quickly and only having three antimatter seats won't help him find a place on your voyages easily.

While historically a common inclusion for weekends, Data’s events have shriveled like Lake Mead in 2022 (only 2), after 5 in 2021. Let’s hope 2023 is a rebound year! If he does get called to the stage, he comes with a solid CMD base for those ever-present CMD and CMD+DIP shuttles.

Datae usually get solidly traited but this variant is not. With 2 collections at launch, his usual racial Android and the obvious Musician, he could catch 2 more to bring him to 4 total with Romantic and Artist.

Does anyone really understand Crit Rating? Well, he’s got some of that for ship battles, plus little to no gauntlet to speak of. Blue skies, everyone!
