The flesh and blood version of Geordi’s creepy holographic crush, this pre-Benteen ice queen has little use in today’s game. Dead on Voyages, Gauntlet, and in most Events, Leah is going to have to wait for her ancillary Traits to hit before she gets any love on the weekends and will probably top out at a meager two Collections. Avoid!
