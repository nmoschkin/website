A 2021 release, Captain Saru might have accidentally time traveled from 2018 - or at least his stats did. His quartet of Collections is the highlight here (by far), though he will catch the occasional Event, if not as frequently as his Disco-inflated Event count might suggest. Saru's Voyage usability is scheduled to be Execute(d) as this version pairs a bloated skill set with ugly debut power. After a run of good-to-godlike Legendary variants, this is one Saru you can leave on the shelf.
