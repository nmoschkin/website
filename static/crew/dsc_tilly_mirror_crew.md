For many years, the Slayer of Sorna Prime was one of the most desired crew in Timelines for her meta-breaking Ship Ability of 400% Instant Damage at six seconds, she would slay many a Skirmish Event and your Arena opponents. 

Killy is still among the top crew for Ships, but several direct upgrades have come along and tarnished that gold Terran Empire Starfleet uniform of hers, including Tactical MACO Mayweather (affectionately called TACO) and Fleet Boss Battles Exclusive Chances Taken Kirk, both of which do not include Killy’s -3 Evasion Penalty, or her 2 Use Limit.

That being said, it takes a long time to get to Kirk and TACO is expensive to get from Crew Retrieval, so happily take Killy from your Legendary Beholds and bank on a variety of variant and Trait bonus Events a year, even though Discovery Mega Events may or may not be done forever (you’ve heard this one before right?). Three Collections also make her a decent choice from that front.
