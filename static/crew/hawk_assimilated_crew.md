"Mr. Hawk...what are you doing in such a filthy uniform?" There's some fanfic we're happy didn't materialize. Uh, it doesn't exist...right?

Hawk has aged out of Voyages unfortunately, but a great pair of Shuttle-friendly SEC and CMD Bases have done alright for themselves in the past, but without any variants to cushion the droughts, he may disappear on Event shuttles for long stretches.

He's also roughly halfway through his Collection profile if one assumes that WRG will try to include most all Traits. A worthwhile contributor in multiple areas.
