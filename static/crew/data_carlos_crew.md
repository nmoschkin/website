Carlos Data debuted as a fantastic Voyager with a plus Skill set, and even though time inevitably Power Creepsâ„¢ our favorite crew out of daily use, this noted South American still has areas to contribute. A trio of Collections and another Trait in reserve gives him enduring value, and Data is a blue chip Event name even though his Skill set does not generally lend itself to Faction Shuttle seating. Carlos is a safe choice in a Behold or a solid inclusion on your Crew Retrieval list.
