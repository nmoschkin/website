I've never met a God before.' 'Nor I a work of art, Madam.' 

I may be mixing my episodes, but the pretty-in-pink Lieutenant is one for the art lovers - at least the art lovers who haven't checked her Memory Alpha page in a while. 

Put plainly and simply, Carolyn has not aged well (from a game utility perspective), since her one use on debut was Voyages and Power Creep has slapped her down hard. Her Trait set includes two esoteric ones unlikely to find a future Collection, the ginormous Romantic, and the ubiquitous Human/Federation/Starfleet.
