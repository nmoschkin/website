But there is a danger in lingering in the ethereal realm of that which could be, but is not.","rules":"-- There are two Phases to this Event! Each Phase is individually timed.\n-- In this Hybrid Event, you will complete Supply Missions in one phase, and Specialist Missions in another phase.\n-- In a Specialist Event, you will select crew to engage in Specialist Missions.\n-- Only a single crew with corresponding skills can be assigned to a Specialist Mission. After the mission is complete, that crew will be disabled from doing Specialist Missions for some period of time.\n-- Specialist Missions take time to complete. The higher selected crew skills are the less time it will take them to complete a mission.\n-- Only the highest skill of a crew is considered when calculating time to complete a mission.\n-- Using crew with matching Specialist Mission bonus traits will significantly decrease time needed to complete a mission.\n-- Each time a Specialist Mission is completed, some progress is also gained on the Main Mission. Completing the Main Mission rewards substantial amounts of Event Victory Points.\n-- When you fail to gain bonus progress on the Main Mission using featured crew or crew with matching event bonus traits, the bonus progress chance goes up slightly the next time you use such crew in a mission. If you score the bonus progress, the bonus chance amount goes back to its initial value. \n-- Using any version of Minuet, Fenna, Charlene, or Holograms will provide a bonus to Supply Missions and Specialist Missions.\n-- Every Faction or Specialist Mission you complete earns you Event Victory Points. Collect Event Victory Points to unlock Threshold Rewards!\n-- Community Rewards are also available during Phase 1 only. Collect Event Victory Points to unlock these rewards before the phase change!\n-- In this event, Squadrons may also compete to advance up the Squadron leaderboards. Join a Squadron to get more rewards!\n","bonus_text":"Crew Bonus: Minuet, Fenna, Charlene, or Holograms","rewards_teaser":"Reach Rank 1 by gaining Victory Points from Event Missions!","shop_layout":"standalone_premium_bundle_0","featured_crew":[{"type":1,"id":29015,"symbol":"seven_social_immersion_crew","name":"Seven","full_name":"Social Immersion Seven","flavor":"Seven decided to create her own holoprogram where she was a human - with her successes, victories and weaknesses.","icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_seven_social_immersion_icon"},"portrait":{"file":"/crew_portraits/cm_seven_social_immersion_sm"},"rarity":5,"full_body":{"file":"/crew_full_body/cm_seven_social_immersion_full"},"skills":{"command_skill":{"core":68,"range_min":44,"range_max":80},"science_skill":{"core":57,"range_min":17,"range_max":34},"engineering_skill":{"core":31,"range_min":17,"range_max":31}},"traits":["human","borg","federation","romantic","costumed","desperate","musician","festive"],"action":{"bonus_amount":5,"charge_phases":[{"charge_time":2,"ability_amount":18000},{"charge_time":4,"ability_amount":20000}],"name":"The Past Few Days Have Been Memorable","symbol":"seven_social_immersion_action","cooldown":8,"initial_cooldown":8,"duration":10,"bonus_type":2,"crew":0,"crew_archetype_id":29015,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_seven_social_immersion_icon"},"ability":{"condition":0,"type":5,"amount":15000},"special":false},"quantity":1},{"type":1,"id":29012,"symbol":"fenna_crew","name":"Fenna","full_name":"Fenna","flavor":"Fenna was a projection of Nidell when she was in deep emotional distress.","icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_fenna_icon"},"portrait":{"file":"/crew_portraits/cm_fenna_sm"},"rarity":4,"full_body":{"file":"/crew_full_body/cm_fenna_full"},"skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":57,"range_min":14,"range_max":29},"science_skill":{"core":41,"range_min":21,"range_max":22},"command_skill":{"core":21,"range_min":6,"range_max":21}},"traits":["halanan","civilian","romantic","telepath","resourceful","cosmic","inspiring"],"action":{"bonus_amount":3,"name":"I Wish I Could Stay Longer","symbol":"fenna_action","cooldown":10,"initial_cooldown":10,"duration":10,"bonus_type":0,"crew":0,"crew_archetype_id":29012,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_fenna_icon"},"ability":{"condition":4,"type":5,"amount":15000},"special":false},"quantity":1},{"type":1,"id":23561,"symbol":"charlene_crew","name":"Charlene","full_name":"Charlene","flavor":"The Doctorâ€™s holographic wife with whom he explored what it might be like to be a working father.","icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_charlene_icon"},"portrait":{"file":"/crew_portraits/cm_charlene_sm"},"rarity":4,"full_body":{"file":"/crew_full_body/cm_charlene_full"},"skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":57,"range_min":14,"range_max":29},"command_skill":{"core":41,"range_min":11,"range_max":22},"science_skill":{"core":21,"range_min":6,"range_max":12}},"traits":["hologram","human","caregiver","romantic","casual","civilian"],"action":{"bonus_amount":5,"name":"Line Up Next To The Door, Children","symbol":"charlene_action","cooldown":12,"initial_cooldown":6,"duration":12,"bonus_type":2,"crew":0,"crew_archetype_id":23561,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_charlene_icon"},"ability":{"condition":0,"type":5,"amount":12000},"special":false},"quantity":1}],"threshold_rewards":[{"points":10,"rewards":[{"type":3,"id":2864,"symbol":"energy","name":"Chronitons","full_name":"Chronitons","flavor":"Chronitons allow your crew to take action in these chaotic times.
