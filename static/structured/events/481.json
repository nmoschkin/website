{"id":404,"symbol":"event_hvspe_neverendingquest","name":"Neverending Quest","description":"Fissures and anomalies collide as the prime universe is threatened to be torn asunder. Individuals are arriving via anomaly only to be pulled into a fissure. Reality itself has begun to blur. Can you tease apart what is and what could be?","rules":"-- There are two Phases to this Event! Each Phase is individually timed.\n-- In this Hybrid Event, you will complete Voyages in one phase, and Specialist Missions in another phase.\n-- In the Voyage Phase, you will engage in Voyages with ocassional Voyage Encounters that will test proficiencies of your voyage crew.\n-- Gold and Silver skills for the Voyage Phase will be SEC and ENG. \n-- Voyage Encounters take place at the following points in time: 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 1.5 hours, 2 hours, and every 2 hours after that.\n-- Passing a Voyage Encounter without losing any contests raises the multiplier for Victory Points gained in contests. Losing a contest resets this multiplier.\n-- Three of the following traits are randomly chosen for each Encounter: Inspiring, Explorer, Scoundrel, Casual, Playful, Hero, Marksman, Investigator. Using crew with matching traits increases their Crit Chance in contests.\n-- In the Specialist Phase, you will select crew to engage in Specialist Missions.\n-- Only a single crew with corresponding skills can be assigned to a Specialist Mission. After the mission is complete, that crew will be disabled from doing Specialist Missions for some period of time.\n-- Specialist Missions take time to complete. The higher selected crew skills are the less time it will take them to complete a mission.\n-- Only the highest skill of a crew is considered when calculating time to complete a mission.\n-- Using crew with matching Specialist Mission bonus traits will significantly decrease time needed to complete a mission.\n-- Each time a Specialist Mission is completed, some progress is also gained on the Main Mission. Completing the Main Mission rewards substantial amounts of Event Victory Points.\n-- When you fail to gain bonus progress on the Main Mission using featured crew or crew with matching event bonus traits, the bonus progress chance goes up slightly the next time you use such crew in a mission. If you score the bonus progress, the bonus chance amount goes back to its initial value. \n-- Using Fissure Quest T'Pol, any version of Archer, Libby, Kim, STT Originals, Displaced, Temporal Agents, or Mirror Universe crew will provide a bonus to antimatter and a permanent multiplier to passively gained Victory Points during the Voyage Phase, as well as bonus to Specialist Missions during the Specialist Phase.\n-- Using the Alternate Probability Cerritos, the Gorn Raider, or the Terran Empire Constellation Class Ship will provide a bonus to antimatter during the Voyage Phase.\n-- Using ships with the Battlecruiser trait will provide a bonus to antimatter during the Voyage Phase.\n-- In the Voyage Phase you earn Event Victory Points passively by running a voyage, and actively by winning contests during Voyage Encounters. The amount you earn increases with every Voyage Encounter passed. \n-- In the Specialist Phase every Specialist Mission you complete earns you Event Victory Points. \n-- Collect Event Victory Points to unlock Threshold Rewards!\n-- Community Rewards are also available during Phase 2 only. Collect Event Victory Points to unlock these rewards before the phase change!\n-- In this event, Squadrons may also compete to advance up the Squadron leaderboards. Join a Squadron to get more rewards!\n","bonus_text":"Bonus: Fissure Quest T'Pol, Archer, Libby, Kim, STT Originals, Displaced, Temporal Agents, Mirror Universe","rewards_teaser":"Reach Rank 1 by gaining Victory Points from Event Missions!","shop_layout":"standalone_premium_bundle_0","featured_crew":[{"type":1,"id":28183,"symbol":"khan_mirror_crew","name":"Khan","full_name":"Mirror Khan","flavor":"Khan’s genetic experiments were banned by the Terran Empire, but in doing so, was the Empire giving up a potential edge against its enemies?","icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_khan_mirror_icon"},"portrait":{"file":"/crew_portraits/cm_khan_mirror_sm"},"rarity":5,"full_body":{"file":"/crew_full_body/cm_khan_mirror_full"},"skills":{"science_skill":{"core":73,"range_min":22,"range_max":46},"engineering_skill":{"core":52,"range_min":33,"range_max":34},"security_skill":{"core":31,"range_min":8,"range_max":31}},"traits":["human","augment","mirror_universe","terran_empire","engineered","innovator","royalty","tactician","geneticist","explorer"],"action":{"bonus_amount":6,"name":"Beware!
