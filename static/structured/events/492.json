For the Organians, this discord brings them pain and they can no longer find refuge. They take matters into their own hands, but their solution only create more problems.","rules":"-- This is an Anomaly Event! The following rule changes will apply:\n1. Double antimatter bonus for featured trait crew (Cosmic). 100 antimatter bonus up from 50.\n2. Double passive Victory Points gain bonus for featured event crew and crew with featured event trait. 60% bonus per crew up from 30%, 30% bonus per trait up from 15%.\n3. Boss Encounters happen every 2 hours.\n4. Bosses have higher base proficiencies, base Crit Chance, and Crit Chance increment. 300 Min Proficiency up from 200, 800 Max Proficiency up from 550, 15% Crit Chance up from 10%, 7% Crit Chance increment up from 5%.\n5. Reduced antimatter penalty for losing contests. 12 antimatter penalty down from 50.\n6. Voyage Encounters take place at the following points in time: 1 minute, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, and every 6 hours after that.\n-- In a Voyage Event, you will engage in Voyages with occasional Voyage Encounters that will test proficiencies of your voyage crew.\n-- In this event, Gold and Silver skills for Voyages will be DIP and MED. \n-- Passing a Voyage Encounter without losing any contests raises the multiplier for Victory Points gained in contests. Losing a contest resets this multiplier.\n-- Three of the following traits are randomly chosen for each Encounter: Inspiring, Explorer, Scoundrel, Casual, Playful, Hero, Marksman, Investigator. Using crew with matching traits increases their Crit Chance in contests.\n-- Using Ayelborne, any version of Doe, O'Connor, Hedford, or Cosmic crew will provide a bonus to antimatter and a permanent multiplier to passively gained Victory Points.\n-- Using the Species 8472 Bioship, the U.S.S. Voyager-J, the Miranda Class Ship, or ships with the Fighter trait will provide a bonus to antimatter.\n-- Earn Event Victory Points passively by running a voyage, and actively by winning contests during Voyage Encounters. The amount you earn increases with every Voyage Encounter passed. \n-- Collect Event Victory Points to unlock Threshold Rewards!\n-- In this event, Squadrons may also compete to advance up the Squadron leaderboards.
