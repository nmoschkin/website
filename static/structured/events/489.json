But the anomaly crisis has also led to the secret getting out. Can the galaxy's most dangerous secret be kept under wraps?","rules":"-- There are two Phases to this Event! Each Phase is individually timed.\n-- In this Hybrid Event, you will complete Supply Missions in one phase, and Specialist Missions in another phase.\n-- In a Specialist Event, you will select crew to engage in Specialist Missions.\n-- Only a single crew with corresponding skills can be assigned to a Specialist Mission. After the mission is complete, that crew will be disabled from doing Specialist Missions for some period of time.\n-- Specialist Missions take time to complete. The higher selected crew skills are the less time it will take them to complete a mission.\n-- Only the highest skill of a crew is considered when calculating time to complete a mission.\n-- Using crew with matching Specialist Mission bonus traits will significantly decrease time needed to complete a mission.\n-- Each time a Specialist Mission is completed, some progress is also gained on the Main Mission. Completing the Main Mission rewards substantial amounts of Event Victory Points.\n-- When you fail to gain bonus progress on the Main Mission using featured crew or crew with matching event bonus traits, the bonus progress chance goes up slightly the next time you use such crew in a mission. If you score the bonus progress, the bonus chance amount goes back to its initial value. \n-- Using any version of Progenitor, Vellek, Brooks, or Undercover Operatives will provide a bonus to Supply Missions and Specialist Missions.\n-- Every Faction or Specialist Mission you complete earns you Event Victory Points. Collect Event Victory Points to unlock Threshold Rewards!\n-- Community Rewards are also available during Phase 1 only. Collect Event Victory Points to unlock these rewards before the phase change!\n-- In this event, Squadrons may also compete to advance up the Squadron leaderboards. Join a Squadron to get more rewards!\n","bonus_text":"Crew Bonus: Progenitor, Vellek, Brooks, or Undercover Operatives","rewards_teaser":"Reach Rank 1 by gaining Victory Points from Event Missions!","shop_layout":"standalone_premium_bundle_0","featured_crew":[{"type":1,"id":28599,"symbol":"torres_short_fuse_crew","name":"Torres","full_name":"Short Fuse Torres","flavor":"Torres' Klingon aggression sometimes comes in handy, such as when faced with a Malon who was sabotaging the ship and was not in the mood for negotiations.","icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_torres_short_fuse_icon"},"portrait":{"file":"/crew_portraits/cm_torres_short_fuse_sm"},"rarity":5,"full_body":{"file":"/crew_full_body/cm_torres_short_fuse_full"},"skills":{"security_skill":{"core":73,"range_min":44,"range_max":46},"engineering_skill":{"core":52,"range_min":33,"range_max":61},"command_skill":{"core":31,"range_min":8,"range_max":31}},"traits":["human","klingon","federation","starfleet","desperate","duelist","brutal","tactician"],"action":{"bonus_amount":6,"name":"Get The Hell Away From There, Now!","symbol":"torres_short_fuse_action","cooldown":10,"initial_cooldown":8,"duration":10,"limit":2,"bonus_type":0,"crew":0,"crew_archetype_id":28599,"icon":{"file":"/crew_icons/cm_torres_short_fuse_icon"},"ability":{"condition":0,"type":1,"amount":400},"special":false},"quantity":1},{"type":1,"id":28598,"symbol":"brooks_gannet_crew","name":"Brooks","full_name":"Gannet Brooks","flavor":"Journalist and ex-lover of Mayweather.
