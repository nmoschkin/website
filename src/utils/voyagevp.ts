/*
base encounter VP is 10, and each drop is 10 x (multiplier)^2.
The multiplier is shown during the encounter and goes up when passed. The number of rounds per encounter gradually increases.
It starts with 3x 3 round, then 4x 4 rounds, 5x 5 rounds, and 6 for all the rest.
example: for the very first encounter (1 min), you can get a total of 3 x 10 x 1^2 = 30 VP.
At the 10th, it's 5 x 10 x 10^2 = 5000 VP

Passive VP
base passive VP goes 1,2,3,6,12,18,25,32,39, [+7]..., etc. and changes at encounters
encounter cadence is 1, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 240, [+120]..., etc. minutes
crew VP bonuses are 15% (variant/trait) and 30% (featured)
drops are every 140 seconds
example: let's say you have 3 featured crew, 4 trait, 3 variant, 2 other:
VP_bonus = 3x30% + 4x15% + 3x15% = 195%.
The first drop happens at 2m20s, so after the first encounter,
and the base VP per drop is 2.
With 195% bonus, VP_drop_1 = (1 + 1.95)*2 = 5.9 -> 5VP (floored not rounded).
The 10th drop happens at 23m20s which is after the 3rd encounter,
so base VP is now 6 and VP_drop_10 = (1+1.95)*6 = 17.7 -> 17VP.
Between hours 2 and 4 of the voyage, each drop is (1+1.95)*46 = 135.7 -> 135VP
